Three eggs, potatoes and crispy bacon!!!! Service was excellent and food arrived very quickly and hot!!!! Great meal!!!!"
412,23 January 2017,30,Super Rush on weekends,You have to wait in long queue for getting a seat. Don't think it is worth the wait. Or else you have to sit in bar counter which is not appealing.
413,20 January 2017,30,Normal food,"Has your basic foods found in all restaurants. Ordered the steak fajitas and they came out dry order was wrong the server offered to fix it however, I didn't have time to wait. Beer selection is limited."

417,14 January 2017,40,fun place with gluten free menu!,This is a fun place. They have a good selection for gluten free food. prices are typical nyc but food is worth it except the gluten free bun was hard. Service could be a bit better though.
418,13 January 2017,50,HRC New York,Very helpful and friendly staff. Sat pretty much straight away and our waiter recommended their local legendary 'pizza burger' which didn't disappoint!
419,13 January 2017,40,Hip place in nyc,My daughter and I went for dinner here. I got a huge salad with chicken and all sorts of good toppings. My daughter got a burger. The server was good and attentive and it seems to be a well run place.
420,8 January 2017,50,Amazing!,There was a 45 min wait to be seated but it was worth it! The food was lovely.......tasty and hot! The atmosphere was really nice. We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

424,2 January 2017,10,Bad service,I'm drinking a moskow mule at the bar right now. Very bad service. The drink is on the average of nothing. No tip for the guy. He doesn't even say hello to us.
425,2 January 2017,50,Very cool place to visit,This is like a mini music museum. We had a good dinner but found it to be a bit pricey for what you get. Otherwise our service was great and we just had fun looking at all of the memorabilia.
426,2 January 2017,50,Celebrating my sons 18th bday today 1st Jan,"They told us a wait for 1.30 mins, we decided to wait, only waited 45mins, the meal was lovely, best meal I've had all holiday, felt very sorry for waitress she had started at 10.30 am til 1.00pm crazy. Great place, reasonable"
427,30 December 2016,20,Ok....,Nothing spectacular! Service was rather slow and when ordering the large pulled chicken burger. Came on a tiny plate and was cold. Not really impressed for the price. Such as shame as was really looking forward to going here!
428,30 December 2016,50,Great Ambience,Rocking ambience. The food wasn't the huge portions that I expected it to be. They were small and average tasting burgers. Although the chocolate molten cake was scrumptious & it simply melts in your mouth!
429,30 December 2016,50,Good atmosphere and service,"Although the restaurant was busy we were seated promptly (they told us 1/2 hr but buzzed in 5 minutes). Good food, large portions, I was full with a starter, good service and overall a great restaurant."

432,29 December 2016,50,Love this place,"Our ""table friend"" was Jonathan who made our night just perfect. He went out of his way to attend to our needs and nothing was too much. The food was lovely, atmosphere spot on and service amazing. Would most definitely recommend."
433,27 December 2016,40,Good,"I'm not a lover of Hard Rock but i found that place so full of music history, as should be every Hard Rock! I have drank only a beer so i can't judge food but i liked service, it was very kind and funny!"
434,24 December 2016,40,Always a good time!,"We dipped in here on a cold Friday night because the waiting area is inside. Awesome memorabilia everywhere. We were seated on about 35 minutes, great service and food was good. I would have rated 5 but our appetizer was lukewarm. Cool experience"
435,22 December 2016,40,Great atmosphere,"This was one of our first eats on our first trip to NYC. Staff were friendly and food was fairly quick to come out. Ate Mozzarella Sticks and Chicken Strips, washed down with a few beers! Establishment was clean, no complaints from us."
436,18 December 2016,50,Great,The atmosphere was great spent time looking at the exhibits on show. The food was brilliant and the cocktails were to die for!!!!!! We went there twice for our evening meals and once for breakfast in our weeks stay in New York.
437,17 December 2016,30,Lunch with tourist friends,The food is average. You go more for the atmosphere and the name. The burgers and fries are good. It's a tourist thong to do.
438,17 December 2016,20,Deception,"We visited because of the fame and the decoration is really nice, but the food, you have multiple better options around. The price, was disprportionated. We won't repeat."
439,16 December 2016,40,good atmosphere but bit of a wait for tables,"Food and service were good, prices a bit high, but we knew that going in. loved to see the memorabilia."
440,13 December 2016,50,Can't not do Hard Rock!,"Just go there...it might be a wait for the table but just go. Food is great, atmosphere is superb and as a Hard Rock experience can't be faulted!"
441,8 December 2016,40,Great way to finish a perfect stay with the last night meal at the hard rock,Great food the staff were so help full food was. So good the soda was refilled as you eat just part of the service Food tasted so good with a great back ground it made the last night so good
442,8 December 2016,40,Nice place,"We came inn a little bit late before closing time. But they fixed good food inn noen time. Nice people, good food, clean place and clean restroom."
443,8 December 2016,30,"very good music (of course) nice staff, bu slow service, average food","every ""hard rock cafe"" is an experience, this one is it too. The waiters and waitresses are very kind and ""cool"", but the service takes a long time. The food was average but OK. Pretty expensive for what you get."
444,7 December 2016,30,Not the best Hard Rock Cafe that I have visited,Visited this restaurant on my recent trip to New York found the food very average had the hard rock burger and fries which had little taste will probably not return here again
445,7 December 2016,30,"December 7, 2016",Ate here for lunch today. Wasn't very busy but the service was just mediocre. Very few visits from our waitress. Food was ok.
446,6 December 2016,10,Stick to the gift shop,"If you want to wait for a while then pay too much for a mediocre burger in really cool looking very crowded surroundings then this is the spot for you. Otherwise focus on the gift shop, buy a Hard Rock pin then head for McDonalds."
447,5 December 2016,30,Had to visit,"It's a little old and odd inside with low ceilings, a true basement bar. Service with bartender Pandora was great."
448,4 December 2016,40,Birthday 21st,"Great atmosphere, buzzing with people, great location good food but pricey. Don't get starters as we did nachos were massive, couldn't eat all mains."
449,3 December 2016,40,Good version of this restaurant,"Had a good all around experience at this restaurant. The service was good. The staff was fast, friendly and willing to help. The food was very good and delivered fast."
450,29 November 2016,50,Tourist haven,The Hard Rock in midtown is very cool and has great memorabilia. The food and drink are typical of all Hard Rocks and was ok...nothing special there. New York pricing though! Fun. Would recommend for the box to be checked.
451,28 November 2016,10,Poor servixe,"Group of 6, bad service, bad food!!!! Burger was dry, and took ages for drinks to come!!! No flavour in any food"
452,28 November 2016,40,Great experience,"First time in NYC and came here twice, beer was good, wings were good (took a while to come) but Michelle was an awesome server which is why I came back. Definitely worth a visit when in Times Square"
453,26 November 2016,50,Awesome. Big portions,Good atmosphere and the staff were all very welcoming and fun. We had a starter and main and wow the starters are huge! The cocktails are great and the cup is a brilliant merchandise to keep.
454,26 November 2016,40,Cool Place with good American Food.,Went here for lunch and had a great burger and shake. They have some cool stuff in this location and it is not uncommon to see rockers there having a bite.
455,26 November 2016,50,Prompt but cold,We hadnt booked and was seated within 10mins. Food was of a good standard as always. Only complaints.... lower 'deck' was cold and finished plates were taken away before everyone was finished. Maybe this is English politeness to wait until everyone has finished.
456,24 November 2016,50,Good food and friendly staff,"As any Hard Rock Cafe around the world, it has a great atmosphere and friendly staff. It will be a good choice if you're looking for late dinner since they close @ 1:00 am"

458,23 November 2016,30,Slow bar service,"We stopped for a drink. Took forever to get service, even though the bar wasn't crowded. We only ordered drinks, so the waitress wasn't attentive. 2 cokes & 1 tequila was $23. Very large place."
459,22 November 2016,40,Great eats!,Great food - lots of choices and great service. Be prepared to wait - very popular spot. Use the time to take pics with memorabilia or see Times Square.

464,14 November 2016,20,Nice store crappy food.,Terrible food. Chicken was rubber. The nachos were soggy. One of our friends had to send the plate back. They did take off the cost of the meal.
465,13 November 2016,50,You know what to expect,"You know what to expect, since it's the Hard Rock Cafe, but it was as really a great experience. Loved my juicy legendary local burger and the Long Island ice tea was a new discovery. Had fun, a great time and great food."
466,8 November 2016,50,Great Atmosphere,We just dropped in for a beer - which cost us $20 for 2. We did however take in the atmosphere and all the guitars displayed were amazing. We also bought a tee-shirt for our nephew in the shop on our way out!

480,26 October 2016,30,Surprise! Far better than I thought it would be,"Had a hamburger in New York on Broadway with my granddaughter. It was a decent burger. I was surprised. So my thought for people who have kids and grandkids who want to go here, don't fight it. It will be okay."

491,15 October 2016,10,Don't bother,"Bad food and bad service... the fajitas was cold, served in a very sloppy way. The worst was that the burger ordered from the glutenfree menu came with a regular onionring full of gluten. How is this even possible?"
492,10 October 2016,10,Horrible,"Food was ok. Ran out of steak on a Sunday. Really. Seater was a horrible, person. Major attitude. Made faces behind customers back and when busted made just laughed. Not funny or professional. Management didn't care. Will never go in another hard rock ANYWHERE"

663,9 April 2016,50,Decent,As ever...Great Experience. Joseph our waiter was very good...always a smile and very chatty to say he was rushed off his feet. Food was as normal...very nice...said our waiting time was 45 mins...we were sat down within 15 mins so all was good.
664,7 April 2016,20,Not Very Good,To be honest i really disliked this restaurant. They didn't have great food like others and it just wasn't very great food.
665,7 April 2016,40,Rock in' out at the Hard Rock,"The food was good, the service was good and the atmosphere was strictly ""Hard Rock"". The prices were good for NYC."
666,7 April 2016,50,Good american food and good ambience,"Always full and keeping qualityt os a woth place to eat if you are looking for music and a bit of party. Friendly Service, good food, drinks and music $$$"
667,5 April 2016,30,Tourist trap,"This place is big, but don't expect too see many locals here. The title says it all; the chain has outlets in a number of cities. Nothing well prepared or gourmet about the food, but the portions are substantial & that's good for sharing."
668,4 April 2016,50,Always great to visit,As it says it's a Rock cafe and with buzzing tunes blasting out with video screens and fantastic staff this is a great place eat and drink in New Yorks Times Square.
669,3 April 2016,40,Reward Visit,It was very busy and the menu doesn't have a lot of options. We spent about 3 hours there. I needed to use up my reward points. Nothing exciting about the visit
670,3 April 2016,50,Good lunch!,Folk's we decided to stop by and have some burgers and cold beer and this is place is very nice. The staff was very professional and polite and the food and drinks were great. I will stop again on my next trip here to NYC.
671,2 April 2016,30,The same,When you go to one you have seen them all. Collecting drum sticks is the reason I go. The whole concept is outdated. Time for new things. Predictable in food and entertainment. But ok. Disneyland for musiclovers from the past.
672,2 April 2016,40,Meal card gave great value,"We had prepaid a meal and knoew our cjhoices, our server was very good and the food came quickly and the burgers were really good. You could have free soft drink refills."
673,2 April 2016,50,Great place,"Great food, great staff, great service, book in advance, enjoy the music and the atmosphere. Well worth the visit. My wife had her 40th birthday there and they bent over backwards to give her a great birthday. Huge thanks to them."
674,1 April 2016,50,Day 3,Loved this place I could have stayed in hear for the rest of the day but daughter wouldn't let me. Lots of memorabilia to look at cocktails and food were good very relaxing
675,30 March 2016,40,Extra-cool,"I always remember it with a smile. Excellent food, good music, greatful atmosphere, waitresses always funny and careful about the clients!"
676,28 March 2016,20,Way Overpriced! Food so so,"If you wanna drop $130 for lunch, then this is the place! This place is way overpriced and the food is below average to average. Flip side is, servers are super nice"
677,28 March 2016,40,Busy,Very busy but plenty of memorabilia to look at while your waiting. If you are looking for some where quiet and don't like loud music this is not the place for you.
678,24 March 2016,30,Portions too small!,The food quality was quite good but the portion size was a bit too small for my liking and they also got my order wrong. The theming was good and it carried through the whole restaurant.
679,20 March 2016,40,Give it a go,"Very busy place get there before 6 pm if u don't want to wait. Big meals not to expensive and drinks reasonable,food good choice and good quality ."
680,20 March 2016,50,Nice dinner. Lively atmosphere.,"Nice dinner, lively atmosphere, everything you'd expect from a hard rock cafe, yes it was busy but we never felt rushed, good service and food was well presented. Crushed berry cocktail is recommended is you want a refreshing drink."
681,19 March 2016,30,What You Expect From Hard Rock,"The food at this location is like everything else ""New York""... Expensive!! The menu and loud, rock atmosphere is much like what you expect at any Hard Rock Cafe. I try to visit them everywhere we travel, but they are predictable."
682,19 March 2016,20,"Food was predictable, and service wasn't great",Same food as other locations but predictable and good for families. Our server wasn't at all on top of our needs. Mains were served before we were doe with our appetizers. Drinks were gone and we had to ask the manager about getting more.
683,18 March 2016,10,Horrendous service and attitude at host stand,"Terrible experience, went in at midnight, host said closed people dining, asked if open till 1am as advertised and posted, she said they are still closed. Will never go to Hard Rock again."
684,15 March 2016,40,Its Hard Rock,"I Like Hard rock cafe, but must admit new york's restaurant is a bit crowded, with long lines. But it is hard Rock, and its always an excellente place to share with friends and to drink Large margueritas!"
685,14 March 2016,40,Always good Cocktails!,Stopped for a quick lunch and drink. Excellent Nachos as always! Cocktails a little disappointing on this occasion.
686,13 March 2016,30,Not the best Hard Rock,The waiting staff were really good however the food was pretty average. The ribs didn't have a lot of meat on them. Drinks were pretty good. Couldn't beat the location and decor.
687,13 March 2016,40,Great!,This is another must do in NYC - such a large venue and a great atmosphere. The food is 'ok'. A bit mass produced and bland but I guess you shouldn't expect everything from this place. Great for families and couples.
688,10 March 2016,40,First food stop,We enjoyed our meal here. The restaurant was clean and employees professional and courteous. If you have been to a Hard Rock anywhere else then this one is no different. The food was very good. And prepared as we ordered. No complaints. Would go again.
689,9 March 2016,30,Average food,I am sure this restaurant can serve better meals that I've got. And actually the atmosphere is not bad at all. But my hamburger felt a but synthetic.
690,8 March 2016,40,A must stop,"Very consistent for the quality of the service, food and drink. One of the best HRC for sure. Nicely decorated. Never come to NYC without stopping there for a drink or a meal!"
691,7 March 2016,30,Good standby,Place was busy but service was quick and friendly. Typical chain food restaurant. Cool memorabilia though.
692,4 March 2016,50,I love HRC!,I love the Hard Rock Cafe! Burgers were great. Service was perfect--very friendly and attentive! Always fun.
693,3 March 2016,40,Great food !,"Quick service,great food,polite and friendly staff. Very dark inside this restaurant which made it just a little depressing, music in here is really loud too so it's not really a place I'd take elderly people to, however the food was very good !"
694,3 March 2016,30,Not worth the money,"With a typical Hard Rock Cafe atmosphere, the service is not great and the food doesn't have the expected quality. The hamburger was dry."
695,29 February 2016,40,it's a must do for Rock fans,"when you are in New York and you are a rock fan, you have to visit the Hardrock Cafe. There is always a waiting line, but the food is good and also the drinks. and finally you have to buy the newest Hardrock T-shirts ;-)"
696,27 February 2016,40,A good chain restaurant,Having visited many Hard Rocks this one was not a lot different from the other. Like all the others I have visited the service is good and food very nice. This restaurant is in Times Square so can get very busy.
697,27 February 2016,30,Good nachos and drinks .,Good Nachos and drinks .Cool atmosphere too . Very busy all the time . Service was not great but not poor either .
698,24 February 2016,30,Evening meal,"Quick service, reasonable priced for location. Cheesecake amazing. Food was good apart from no bbq sauce in my bbq burger?"
699,22 February 2016,50,Good service - as your would expect,"We visited as we have many other branches, good food, drink and service and pretty reasonable. A good safe bet for a bite to eat."
700,22 February 2016,40,Great food / great atmosphere,"The restaurant was very busy but after the edit it was worth it . Great music , great food and atmosphere . Best local themed restaurant ."
701,21 February 2016,40,Excellent experience for rock lovers,"Excellent experience for rock lovers. The food is good and you get the chance of seeing The New Creatures, Brian Jones' teardrop guitar, the original Abbey Road door and other memorabilia."
702,20 February 2016,30,Nothing Great,My teenage daughters and I walked in one freezing cold January night after taking a nighttime bus tour. It was cozy warm and the wait only about 20 minutes. The food was okay but nothing great. The staff was friendly enough.
703,20 February 2016,50,flatbread,"Stopped in for a quick appetizer, we shared a Margherita Flatbread f , it was so delicious. Service was great, not overpriced."
704,19 February 2016,50,Better than expected,Food was fantastic but portions are massive. Make sure when ordering desserts that you check whether it's for sharing or not! Service was great also.
705,17 February 2016,50,Consistently brilliant,"Came here with my husband and 2 friends. All of us had cocktails and food, both of which were amazing! The service was brilliant and I thoroughly enjoyed my time here! A must when in NYC"
706,17 February 2016,20,Overrated,This is a popular place for the very young teenage crowd. The wait time is a bit nuts especially for this type of restaurant!!!
707,17 February 2016,40,good food,"they have good food, burger, steak, fries, and some drinks. The one i dont like is the waiting. I understand the restaurant is in tourist place."
708,17 February 2016,10,if you like hair in your nachos,"extremely slow service , the food was good but we found a hair in our food !!! that usually ruins the show ."
709,16 February 2016,40,One of the better HRC,Late lunch with a 20 minute wait was OK. Our waiter Timothy did our order in his head and everything arrived as ordered after a short wait. It was great to leave a HRC without my ears bleeding - good style
710,14 February 2016,50,"GREAT LOCATION, HUGE PORTIONS, LOVELY STAFF","We popped in here for late lunch last Monday. Great atmosphere, lovely food, staff very friendly. Menu varied as you would expect, portion sizes HUGE."
711,13 February 2016,50,Wow,"The best burger I have EVER had. When they ask how you'd like it cooked you get an idea, but nothing prepares you. Insanely good!! Nom Nom"
712,12 February 2016,50,Can't go wrong with Hard Rock,"This is the most impressive Hard Rock restaurant in terms of size, staff, food and memorabilia. We always go to Hard Rock because you know you'll have a great meal with great atmosphere."
713,10 February 2016,50,The best Restaurant I have ever been to,Coming from New Zealand when I am lucky enough to visit New York I always ask if I can be taken to the Hard Rock Café for dinner. Being a huge music fan it really makes me so happy
714,9 February 2016,50,Memories of a lifetime,"The food, the ambiance, the music, the legacy.. well this place has everything of course. I enjoyed some fine drinks along with salmon, and will remember the good time forever.."
715,8 February 2016,40,Hard rock care Times square NYC,"Typical Hard Rock, decent food , good atmosphere, can get very busy but always found a bsr seat. Great location, bit pricey but it is Times Square."
716,8 February 2016,50,Good food,"would recommend, we loved our visit, staff friendly, great service, food amazing but big portions, we went about 6 o'clock but restaurant seemed to get busy about 7ish,very spacious, we would go again"
717,7 February 2016,30,It's the name,"Over the top. Friendly (too ....) staff, it is the name this place is populair. Food is not bad, but the magic (if it ever has been there) is gone, better spend your dollars in an other restaurant"
718,6 February 2016,30,Not what I expected,"We have never been before and was disappointed , felt very dark and no atmosphere. Maybe it's out of season or a bit early in the day, not sure. We had a coffee and left. The staff were very welcoming and friendly."
719,31 January 2016,40,Consistent,"Been to Hard Rock in USA, Canada and Europe. All pretty much the same. Times Square location is conveniently located in the middle of everything. If you are a fan of Hard Rock this location will not disappoint."
720,31 January 2016,50,Service great!,Allan rocks! We went in for drinks and appetizer! Allan was super friendly and gave us some great tips on seeing the city! Relaxed atmosphere!
721,30 January 2016,40,Can't go wrong with Hard Rock Cafe,"Really enjoyed the food as always! Cool venue in an old theatre. Food was good, service was friendly. Great location too."
722,29 January 2016,50,Gorgeous food,Went here 2nights ago for dinner. Atmosphere was brilliant and food was delicious would highly recommend here. Food not badly priced either and portions massive. Staff very friendly and helpful
723,21 January 2016,30,It was the only restaurant open,"which is hard to believe in Times Square. We were actually the last people to be able to order food. I just got a salad, it was ok. I wouldn't choose to eat here, but the staff was nice and we could eat!"

728,18 January 2016,50,NYE at the HA\ard Rock,Got married on NYE in Times Square and had our Reception at the Hard Rock. We were treated like Rock Stars and couldn't have been more pleased to bring in the new year at this place!
729,17 January 2016,50,Nice restaurant downtown,"Great location at times square. Good food, fast service. Prices are a bit expensive but i guess that is all over Manhattan. Recommended!"
730,16 January 2016,40,Hard Rock,Was very much as expected very nice and great atmosphere Easy to find in Time Square and it is next to Bubba Gumps
731,14 January 2016,40,good value,burgers burgers and more burgers. oh and Natchos reasonable value for money but the same as any other hard rock cafe in the world
732,14 January 2016,30,Breakfast was tasty but it took AGES to arrive...,"Me and my boyfriend had breakfast here, I had French toast with bacon, he had some egg dish-the food was really enjoyable and it's a lovely venue, but we waited nearly 45 minutes after ordering to get the food. Pretty poor service."
733,12 January 2016,50,Delicious Hamburgers,"As all Hard Rock cafes the enviroment is awesome. Service was excellent. We tried a Strawerry lemonade that was delicious. Overoll we were very satisfied with our lunch,"
734,11 January 2016,30,Not the best but simple fare for tourists.,Went there after a late play for a burger. Burger was standard and nothing special but the fries were a little soggy. Typical price for NYC but better for a family as it is not above $$.
735,9 January 2016,50,Asked for ID lol,Had cocktails here on our first night. The girl who served us asked me for ID Made my holiday and I had just arrived. Pricey but that's fair enough
736,9 January 2016,10,Lunch,Did not enjoy food was not great Planet Hollywood was far better over priced for what it is Def will not return
737,9 January 2016,50,exciting night,"Good food. lovely atmosphere.. loud good music..quick service..live music ..very good singers....long queue..a wide menu with many specialties..meat, cheese, pizzas..international food and good drinks."
738,9 January 2016,40,What you expect from hard rock cafe,"My favourite Hard Rock Cafe from the many that I've been to. Situated in the middle of the Nathan of Times Square, the wait staff are very friendly and the food is quite decent."
739,8 January 2016,50,Fantastic atmosphere,Great food and large choice of drinks. Brilliant atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and gave amazing customer service. Will be back again.
740,8 January 2016,30,It's alright.,"I've never really seen the big deal with hard rock cafe personally. Its overpriced, completely targets tourists and isn't particularly great. This one did have a nice atmosphere to it though and service is fine, so I can't really complain in that respect."
741,7 January 2016,50,BREAKFAST!!,"the breakfast.... one word OMG!"" all you can eat and really good queality deffo worth a drop in to grab something to eat before a big day"
742,7 January 2016,50,Time Square Meal with music,"The bar is situated close Time Square, it serves nice food, great drinks and as usual in Hard Rock you are surrounded by a nice music."
743,6 January 2016,20,Poor breakfast,"Wen't there for breakfast. For 20 bucks you get slow service, a list of few dishes to choose from and best of all you get to rewards this bad experience with 18% automatic gratuity. First disappointing visit to Hard Rock Cafe."
744,6 January 2016,50,Excellent,"Lovely and enjoyable meal, true American food, cocktails were beautiful and our waitress was very nice and helpful! Enjoyed the photo when we first got there"
745,6 January 2016,40,Huge portions!,Service toke quite a while but it was worth the time. Food is really good and high quality. Portions are huge. Waiters are friendly. But the beer I got wasn't too good tho. Overall of 4/5 stars. Hard Rock Cafe is never disappointing 👍🏻
746,4 January 2016,40,good food with friendly service,family of four left feeling full. out the door under 100 dollars which we were very happy about. great location. Nice scenery and good music selection heard throughout our meal. would definitely return
747,3 January 2016,40,"Great location, busy restaurant","Got in at the right time and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table, waiter didn't seem over interested and we got our starters at the same time as our mains, but the food was really good!"
748,1 January 2016,50,Great food etc etc,"Had a great meal here a couple of days ago, lunch time, ribeye steak, cooked to perfection, good , fast service,you will not be disappointed here ."
749,31 December 2015,50,Night in the city,Dinner was very good and service was terrific. Atmosphere was lively and fun! Great for family and / or groups.
750,31 December 2015,40,Addicted,"I collect this guitar pins and have for 30 years, so it's a must stop. Food is always great and the staff in the shop is super helpful."
751,30 December 2015,30,Chain eating on the Square,The food is average. The wait staff is good at first but it is difficult to get a refill. You may only want to go to say you are at Hard Rock on Times Square.
752,30 December 2015,40,Noisy but nice friendly service,The noise prevented any conversation but the music and surrounding paraphernalia was entertaining. The food servings were massive and when we asked if smaller serves were available we were told that our request couldn't be accommodated. What a waste of food!
753,29 December 2015,30,Don't go without a reservation,Smaller menu than other HRC locations but of course pricier. I think about 20% more than the last time I went in September in Boston.
754,29 December 2015,30,Free with nyc passes,All I can say is iam glad it was free with our nyc passes . Very busy don't know what all the fuss is about food not great wouldn't go again disappointed really .
755,28 December 2015,40,"Great restaurant, very compatible to all other Hard Rocks","Good service received here as can be expected from the HRC. Price is very reasonable given the environment and you don't feel rushed to finish your meal and get out. Located right on Times Square it's easy to find, however booking is definitely required!"
756,28 December 2015,50,Very good!!,Very good restaurant!! very good service very good food the place is beatiful. Recommends to eat there
757,28 December 2015,40,A truly Hard Rock Cafe in all its extent!,"A truly Hard Rock Cafe in all its extent! Great atmosphere, people from all over the world, great staff. Just take into account it gets very crowded."
758,27 December 2015,40,"Great Food, friendly staff",Sat at the bar since it was a 30 min wait for the dining room. The bartender was extremely friendly and the food was good. A little pricy but expected for Times Square.
759,23 December 2015,30,What experience am I paying for?,"Everybody says you should go to Hard Rock for the experience. After a fairly long wait, mediocre food, and an overpriced souvenir shop, I'm still confused as to what experience I invested in."
760,23 December 2015,40,Pretty good,My husband and I ate here for drinks and lunch one day. The food was good and we tried 2 of their specialty cocktails. Both were good but neither were great. Pretty good place to grab a quick bite.
761,21 December 2015,50,Bargain breakfast!,"We stumbled upon this for breakfast one morning, and were happily surprised! For $17, you got a huge breakfast, beverage and tip included! Great food, and great service! Right next to Times Square!"
762,19 December 2015,20,breakfast overpriced,"over priced brekfast, manged to lure me in with wifi only to find out that it didnt work, the food was ok but really expensive for what you get but hey it is what it is"
763,18 December 2015,30,Average Food/Questionable Family Environment,"Food was average, server was energetic and friendly but the videos being shown on the screens were not for young eyes. Probably not a chain I will be rushing back to."
764,17 December 2015,50,"Great place, great food","Really enjoyed our meal, very reasonably priced and the atmosphere is fab. Servers really make the experience a memorable one. Book a table as soon as you can as it gets very very busy!"
765,16 December 2015,40,"Great surroundings, ok food","The restaurant is exactly how one would envisage- glamorous, great atmosphere, really cashing in on its USP. The food was good but pretty blah, nothing too special. Definitely had an all-American feel to this place. Probably wouldn't go again though, having been the once."
766,15 December 2015,40,Hard Rock NYC,"We went to Hard Rock for dinner. They said it would be 45 min. To an Hour wait, but it was only 20 min.. Our waitress was really great, and our food was really good."
767,15 December 2015,40,Steak is amazing,"OMG! The steak was so good i couldnt finish it all. My only suggestion would be to ask for the next up of how you have it cooked at home, i asked for medium but it was more rare."
768,15 December 2015,50,Amazing atmopshere as expected!,We stopped here for a few drinks and were able to sit at the bar. Loved the atmosphere and the service couldn't be faulted.
769,14 December 2015,30,The restaurant was neat but food was blaaaa,The restaurant was a meet place but the food and service were pretty terrible. They butchered my order and did not fix it.Very busy because of the location and name but your definitely treated like just a number.
770,11 December 2015,30,Abfest to pre book,"Very busy. Usual Hard Rock Cafe. It is what it is. Good fun, quick food. Nothing fancy. We just used it as a stop off on the way back to our hotel"

772,1 December 2015,50,Excellent,Had the original burger fantastic ! Staff were really helpful and the memorabilia is fantastic . Chocolate molten cake was excellent
773,30 November 2015,40,Great food and service,"No reservation on a very busy night but we managed to get a table for four. Waitress was very friendly and informative. Our drinks order came quick and food followed not long after that. Food was well presented, big portions and very tasty."
774,29 November 2015,30,very poor services,"We waited ages to be served, other people came in after us and had their meals before we even got our drinks! The food was good when it eventually came though. The drinks are not great though"
775,28 November 2015,40,An evening in Times Square,"Were seated very quickly by very friendly staff, who took an interest in us. Food upto the usual standard for Hard Rocks. Very wheelchair friendly."
776,27 November 2015,40,Great food and service,"Typical Hard Rock.....managed to pre-book through open table and had a brilliant meal........Hard Rock never fail to deliver, great service as always!!!!!"
777,26 November 2015,50,So good!,"This is a great place to come, listen to some good music, take in a great atmosphere, have a few beers and eat some great cooked food! The steak here was delicious and the staff are fantastic!"
778,26 November 2015,50,Great atmosphere in Times Square,"Really good food and lots of cool things to see in here. A little bit of a wait to get a table, but worth it once we got in. Great music too!"
779,25 November 2015,30,Decent Food but Slow Service,"If you have been to a Hard Rock then this is the same experience as all of the others. Overall the food was good but the service was kind of slow, we waited over an hour to get our food."
780,24 November 2015,40,"Nice place, nice food!",this place is very beautiful with a lots of table and a lots of people..but the service are fast and perfect! I advise you to eat Mexican burger... no words to describe....
781,23 November 2015,50,Great service!,"Service at the Hard Rock in Times Square was great! We didn't know we would get a free glass with our drink and they told us we would when we got our bill. Food was great, had a great time!"
782,23 November 2015,50,ANNES Birthday,Went here to celebrate my wife's Birthday . Booked a table beforehand. Excellant service excellant food . When I mentione it was my wife's birthday they put a candle in our shared ice cream ( Diabetic Nightmare) Pleasant surroundings good memorabilia on the walls.
783,23 November 2015,50,Fab!,"Ate here last week while on holiday in NYC, Food was really nice, Cocktails were fab! Atmosphere was amazing... It's right on Times Square so a perfect dinner before heading off to a show in Broadway!"
784,20 November 2015,40,You know what to expect...,I did visit many Hard Rock Cafe's worldwide and the concept is repeating and you don't get suprises. The menue is always Burgerish & Beerish and there is always a souvenier shop. Had a nice burger with beer and got treated very nicely.
785,18 November 2015,30,Just ok,"Loved the venue and the memorabilia, food was just ok. Felt we were rushed from start to finish. Constantly pressurised for either photo,charity band purchase, glass etc. If you want a quick bite then it's suitable."
786,18 November 2015,40,Ok place,Sat down quite quickly after being shown to our table. When the food was delivered it looked very nice. I could not eat all of it as it was a good portion.
787,17 November 2015,30,Just like any other Hard Rock,Not the best eatery in town however if looking for a quick bite to eat this a good place to go. I do like the rock memorabilia - it is fun!
788,15 November 2015,40,"Good Food, very vibrant","If you want a nice quiet romantic meal then HRC is not for you. The service was good, the food was good, but really noisy. Music and videos are playing all the time."

798,31 October 2015,50,Great experience,"First visit to any Hard Rock Cafe. They didn't disappoint, the service and food was excellent. We had cocktails too which were really good. To top it off we saw David Baddiel but my wife was too chicken to say hello."
799,30 October 2015,50,Good value for money,A typical Hard Rock Cafe situated in the middle of Times Square. Both food and drink were reasonably priced and tasted good. There was a really nice atmosphere and if you want to watch sport there is a large screen.
800,30 October 2015,50,Great meal out,Wonderful atmosphere in a classic hard rock venue. Great food and drink. Would go back again. Enjoy the alcohol free cocktails!

802,28 October 2015,50,Great evening in easy surroundings,Been to several HRC and they never fail to satisfy. NYC Times Square Cafe is as good if not better than most. From the mayhem outside to a great atmosphere inside!
803,28 October 2015,40,Nice experience,"A little slow at the bar, but nice people doing a nice job! Centrally located in the heart of time square."
804,28 October 2015,50,Great Burger,"We were disappointed to find a queue at the Hard Rock Cafe and a half hour wait. We opted to take a seat at the bar and were able to eat there instead of waiting. Really great atmosphere and burger, very American!"
805,28 October 2015,50,"Great atmosphere, food and gift shop!","Very impressed with this store, they have everything you'd expect from a Hard Rock franchise, however is the people that works there that make it special, not over the top, just right. I had a great lunch there too."
806,28 October 2015,40,Good food but freezing cold inside,There is a lot of music memorabilia to look at. The food is good. However it is very cold inside and for us the music was far too loud.
807,27 October 2015,50,hard rock cafe as usual,"a MUST in new york! it's a nice place, a spectacular wall with only guitars. the food is the same as allover. so we entered only to the shop to buy some stuff."
808,27 October 2015,30,Just another Hard Rock Cafe,"There was nothing special about this HRC. Decent food and rock and roll atmosphere with lots of memorabilia. If you have never been to one then it is interesting but if you have been to any other one, nothing new here to see."
809,27 October 2015,30,Typical Hard Rock Tourist Trap,"Food is OK, but price, drinks are good but pricey. This is a Gard Rock Cafe, not too different tan others, pretty much exclusively for tourists or people that have not yer visited a Gard Rock Cagfe."
810,26 October 2015,40,Love The Atmospher,"Wow..just wow.. I went to 3 different hard rock cafe on my last trip.. and this HRC is the best. from the rock shop's collection, the atmospher, the location, the crwods, everything... The staffs also very helpful."

812,26 October 2015,30,"Good service, average food","The hard rock is overrated, I've been to a few and this wasn't anything spectacular. Crazy busy in this place, waited for 45 minutes for a table for two. Our server was great though as were most of the other waiters."
813,25 October 2015,50,Interesting,"Situated in bustling Times Square this is a very busy restaurant with pleasant and efficient staff, the food is good and the decor is brilliant. You could spend half an hour looking at the wall displays of music memorabilia. Well worth a visit."
814,25 October 2015,40,Nice restaurant,The food was ok. I ordered a hamburger well done and it was almost well done. The decor is nice. Staff was very professional and friendly.

816,24 October 2015,40,Hardrock review,"Good dining experience. Bit pricey but you expect that for- 1) the chain & 20) Its location. Good service, a little noisy but great for music memorabilia lovers. I myself spent little time at the table, preferring to look around"
817,22 October 2015,40,"""Great Visit to check out all the Musician's History of our Time & More""",We throughly enjoyed all the history of the Musician's of their time and to see all of the musical instruments right down to Billy Joel's motor bike. Friendly staff and well worth the visit if you are musically inclined.
818,22 October 2015,50,super experience,I love atmosphere and environment of this franchise. One of the best choises in NYC. Try their coctails.
819,22 October 2015,50,Friendly service to the end,Had a pre paid vochure which often creates a pronlem but not here! Fan time had b y us all! Well done!
820,21 October 2015,40,showing my age!!!,"Food good and plenty ,loved the burgers, staff cool and very busy ,but to me (only my opition)I found it a young persons place,very loud music, I should have expected this,showing my age,but go for it if you are young at heart and enjoy"
821,21 October 2015,50,An experience to share,"Whether you are alone, traveling as a couple or with friends you have to stop by this place as it is not only historical in nature but has fantastic service and huge menu that should satisfy anyone."
822,20 October 2015,50,Great Burgers!,"Typical Hard Rock fare, we love their burgers!, Also dessert is always a favorite. Chocolate Cake YUM!"
823,18 October 2015,50,10yrs@times.sq,"This is one of my two favorite Hard Rock cafes in the whole world. It is located at Times square, where its been for 10 years. This restaurant and its merchandise shop are always busy. Good vibes, good food, good service!"
824,17 October 2015,40,First Visit,Strange as it may seem this was my first visit to this chain it will not be my last. I'm not usually a fan of burgers but the ones here could certainly convert me. It was delicious! Look forward to my next visit
825,14 October 2015,50,Great place,"Great place for food, atmosphere and the service is fast. The price is a bit expensive but everything else is worth the detour"

827,14 October 2015,30,Less than what expected!,It is similar to other franchise store all over the world except the abundance of security personnel everywhere. The bar was good and bar tenders are professional but not compare to other cool places all over NYC.
828,13 October 2015,20,"Don't bother, it's not good",Went for breakfast and it was not good. Both the food and service were not good at all unfortunately. There are many other far better places in the area to go to

830,11 October 2015,30,Expensive,"This restaurant was very costly for very average food and drinks. We couldn't finish our food as it was tasteless, I had the macaroni which was quite sickly."
831,9 October 2015,30,Average and Overpriced,Average food although Service was good. Had to wait for 30 minutes for a table but could have a drink at the bar. Drinks and food a little overpriced for what it is.
832,9 October 2015,30,Not worth the line,"The food here is average at best, on par with any chain restaurant the draw is the rock memorabilia. Very cool memorabilia on display, does not make up for over priced average food items. Kids menu provides nice coloring book/souvenir"
833,7 October 2015,40,A must try - original burger is outstanding,"Walking the area of Times Square renders hundreds of restaurants, but Hard Rock is a must try. Museum and surroundings gives you a great setting, food is good quality and prices are, considering the neighbour hood, reasonable. In addition good cocktails and nice desserts."

838,3 October 2015,40,Hard Rock NYC,Obvious ambiance. Great server and friendly staff. Barbecue ribs were somewhat tasteless and not very meaty. Onion rings were a bit soggy.
839,3 October 2015,40,Always wanted to visit here...glad I did,"Great vibe love the theatre style of this place and music theme, bar staff a little officious asking for ID I wasn't flattered I found it annoying, I'm 50 for crying out loud Bit expensive for basically burger and chips"

852,25 September 2015,40,"central location, food consistent","Like most Hard Rocks around the world, this is the same. You know what to expect!

855,23 September 2015,40,Hard rock cafe,Wanted a quick burger meal on way to a Broadway play down the street. Hard Rock Cafe was on the way so we went in. Got that burger in the bar area. Quicker service than the dining area.
856,23 September 2015,40,Not a Better View of Times Square,"Lunch at the Hard Rock Café on Times Square may not be unique and exciting, but it has predictably good food and the best seat in the house for Times Square."
857,23 September 2015,20,The Hard Rock is Not What it Used to Be.,A once reliable place to go for a decent meal at an okay price. This Times Square location has been a nightmare since it opened. How things have changed since the Hard Rock's 57th Street days and not for the better I'm sorry to say.
858,22 September 2015,50,NYCHRC!,"Another great Hard Rock Cafe'!!! This is a "" must stop"" when in NYC!!!! Great Time! The Ribs are to die for. The décor here is fabulous and the service is outstanding!!!"

921,6 August 2015,50,Hard Rock Rocks in all countrys!,"I visited this place with a friend and we have the most fun time, you can take pictures with famous guitars, the decoration is very avant-garde. Excellent food and great atmosphere for a drink and relax. I loved it!"
922,5 August 2015,40,Hard Rock rocks like rock song,"Typical Hard Rock Cafe Experience! Daughter LOVED the lemonade. Everything else was, well, Hard Rock Cafe. The place is huge and I can imagine a long line on busy days. However, we went on a slow day and everything went smoothly."
923,5 August 2015,50,Fun place,Loved it. Great atmosphere. And a Michael Jackson impersonator came out and entertained the crowd while we ate dinner. We like to hit the Hard Rock in every city we visit.
924,2 August 2015,50,Packed with punch,"A lively buzz began with our server and continued throughout the meal, a great location, noise, atmosphere and we were served efficiently and with charm. Photo opportunities abound and there is plenty on the menu to engage diners. This deserves return visits."
925,2 August 2015,40,Very busy but worth it.,"Though this is generally a tourist spot in any city, this store was enjoyable in its own right. Extremely busy, but you are able to sit at the bar and order off the full menu. I was in and out in about 30 minutes."
926,1 August 2015,40,Good lunch,"Good place for lunch. Tasty sandwiches and good service. Lots of memorabilia to look at while you wait. We didn't have to wait for a table, but there was a long line when we left."

930,25 July 2015,40,Good for a break,The service was good and all the burgers come with french fries and sauce and they are very big. It's perfect for a little break for lunch and to spend some time with the family.

933,19 July 2015,10,Absolute awful,Over priced service is terrible. Breakfast was a shambles would rather of given my money to the tramps outside than to this awful rip off restaurant.
934,17 July 2015,30,overpriced,"very busy place with interesting rock decorations, we needed to que and wait for 15 min. the service was very basic, the food was overpriced.."
935,16 July 2015,30,I don't get it,"Why do so many tourists flock to this chain restaurant? With so many other places to visit in NY and better food to eat, why go here?"

939,15 July 2015,50,Great lunch in Times Square,"Right near center of Times Square, was told 25 min wait on a Sat afternoon, buzzer given and waiting area is big, buzzed in only 10 min. Air conditioning felt great on July day. Server very friendly, all our lunches were very good"
940,15 July 2015,20,Very Basic Breakfast,Went here for breakfast. Not much to say other than poor choice and quality of food (served in a buffet style) with an expensive price tag. The redeeming feature would be the building itself which was interesting to take a look around.
941,14 July 2015,40,Great steak and atmosphere,We were able find a seat at the bar right away. Bar tender was great. Food was cooked to order and the service was awesome.

943,9 July 2015,30,"Great atmosphere, average food","Just like any other Hard Rock Cafe around the world, you should firstly visit to see the memorabilia as there is always something that you will have never seen before. As for the food, I ordered the Legendary Bacon Cheeseburger and was disappointed."
944,9 July 2015,30,good food as usual - very poor service,"the place is as good as usual, the food is so good as usual, but what a deception about staff attitude, poor service, long service, so unusual over there. not good at all"
945,9 July 2015,40,Fun Experience - Food is Average,This is a good place to stop in and have a drink to see all the music memorabilia etc. There is much better food throughout the City however the location in Time Square is easy to find and get to walking.

956,29 June 2015,40,"Standard experience, but no prices on the wine list","The food, service and ambience was the same as always. Good experience, exactly what we expected. However, the wine list had no prices. How can I decide what to order if I don't know what it is going to cost?"
957,29 June 2015,40,Good service and friendly staff in a great location,"Great location, staff in the restaurant where very friendly and polite, food was good. Food and drinks served promptly. Also very good atmosphere in the restaurant with lots of memorabilia on the walls. Highly recommended."
958,27 June 2015,30,Average,For Hard Rock Cafe the bar is really ok but with the burger we have been little disappointed especially as you know you pay more as its a Hard Rock Cafe. So go there if you like the atmosphere but not because of food.
959,27 June 2015,20,Average,"This place has nothing on the Orlando one. The low rating is justified. Food was average. Service was slow. Not her fault, she no doubt had heaps of tables to attend to."

967,13 June 2015,30,"Luch, dinner yes, skip breakfast","We thought we'd have a good, hearty breakfast here, but it was just like any other bad motel buffet table. Price wasn't too bad $17, but it wasn't worth it."
968,11 June 2015,40,very good,"the concept is probably known to everyone, the food is excellent and the service friendly and proffesional, and you can see some ''relics'' from stars, it isnt the cheapest but for once it cant hurt"

973,3 June 2015,40,It's a Hard Rock Cafe!!,"Came in for lunch, it was busy but we were well taken care of and the food came quickly. Everything was great... It's a HRC and it does exactly what you expect from one."
974,30 May 2015,40,Good burger and great venue,"Large and interesting space, burgers were good, pleasant enough place to have a couple of beers. It felt like the chain it has become, reliable.... yes, but not quite as unique as it used to be. Would return though."

989,13 April 2015,20,A load of fuss about nothing special,"Had to try it while in Manhattan. Nothing special, except the service, Danny was a real credit to a very average dining experience. Food was ok but there is so. Much better around,and not at sch a cost."
990,8 April 2015,40,Always a favorite,"Hard Rock Cafe is always a favorite, because it's a great value and good food. They are very good at dealing with crowds, and move people in and out efficiently.We enjoy looking around at the unique music collectors items at each restaurant."

1000,18 March 2015,50,great meal,only had to wait 30 minutes which was enough time to see around all the memrorabilia and gift shop. food was tasty with huge portions service was quick considering how busy the place was.
1001,17 March 2015,40,Well worth a visit,"Went for food and the queue was 1.5hrs, however if you go to the bar for a drink while you wait you can eat there and you are effectively skipping the queue, which was excellent for us. Try the New York strip, was very nice."
1002,17 March 2015,30,"Been here a few times when we visit, this was by far the most disappointing.","Had dinner here in December with my friend & our four teenagers. Our server was nice, but our orders were incorrect, items were omitted. Food was not as good as it had been in the past. Very disappointing especially for the price you pay."

1026,8 January 2015,40,Rock N Roll Fever!,Super cool Hard Rock Café! We waited around 45 minutes to dine for dinner. As your waiting you can walk around browse the café and store. This is by far one of my favorite Hard Rock Cafe's I have visited. Super fun and lively atmosphere.
1027,6 January 2015,40,Great staff!,Bar staff helped get us seated with a minor. Even asked a customer to move over for us! Everything after that was slow. Food was good as per the standard. Enjoy
1028,6 January 2015,40,Great staff and food,"We spent the christmas eve dinner and christmas day dinner too. The staff is super nice. The portions are very generous, do not underestimate it. Also the drinks, the fruitpalooza was one of the most delicious drinks i have ever drunk."
1029,1 January 2015,50,"Great food, Cold Drinks, Great atmosphere (just like always)!!","The price of food and drinks at Hard Rock is very reasonable especially for NYC.

1030,30 December 2014,40,Always good!,"Ate lunch with my family before Pinstripe Bowl game, 12/2014. Great atmosphere, food was good, wait time was set at 45 minutes, but seated after about only 25. Service was good. Great selection for kids."

1033,25 December 2014,30,Nice enough - no great shakes,"The staff are really friendly, the food is good (no more than expected) and the pricing is standard. Great atmosphere but all in all no more than expected of a hard rock."
1034,23 December 2014,50,Nice place for a drink,I had a couple of beers at the bar with a lil burger (1200kcal) nice music and friendly staff. Nice hard rock
1035,23 December 2014,20,Nothing special,"Didn't notice anything special, crazy overpriced. If you're not looking for anything history special place, check out other places with better service and food."
1036,21 December 2014,40,"Good, not great","A busy day for the cafe, too many private parties. Main dining area was slow. We got to the cafe just after 4 p.m. amen had to wait 45 minutes for a table. Server worked hard, food was tasty but warm."
1037,19 December 2014,40,as like hard rock cafe,"food is good..with all interior really hard rock... location is superb in broadway, time square... the staff is very friendly and always help you with smile..."
1038,18 December 2014,30,As expected,"Went here for lunch while visiting time square. We've been to a couple Hard Rock restaurants and as expected, this was good. If you've never been to one I recommend it for the experience."
1039,18 December 2014,40,Good Burgers,Hard Rock Cafe is in times square and there is lot of customers but service is fast and burgers tasty.
1040,14 December 2014,30,Standard Hard Rock fair!,"I've eaten at HRC in various cities around the world, and the NYC one is well, just like all the rest! Decent food with huge amounts! Same decor, just a bigger place!"
1041,13 December 2014,30,Standard.,What you'd expect from any Hard Rock Cafe. Service and food was good. Had to sit at the bar and eat even though there were 15-20 empty tables.
1042,11 December 2014,30,Its a Hard Rock.,"Nothing great about this place. Nothing wrong with it either. Just a plain and simple Hard Rock. I went mid-week and didn't have to queue which was a bonus. The food was good, filling as usual. Service was also fine. Just nothing wowed me."
1043,10 December 2014,10,Go somewhere else,First time in New York and went here. Service was appalling and food even worse.... Our burger came up still frozen in the middle. Given a $25 gift card to say sorry but this can only be used on food
1044,7 December 2014,40,Fills Me Up,"Most Hard Rock Cafe food is the same at all locations. The menus might be a bit different, but the food is good and one thing they always do is fill up your plate, so you never leave hungry."
1045,3 December 2014,40,The Legendary Burger,"Try one, you won't be disappointed, and the fries are delicious. One of the best burger and chip meals I've ever eaten, in a brilliant setting full of musical history."
1046,2 December 2014,20,Overpriced diner food,"Hard Rock Café does offer a great atmosphere. If you want to just hang out with friend and not worried about the cuisine, then this is the place for you."
1047,2 December 2014,40,"Good food, neat interior","This is one of the better Hard Rock's I've visited. With New York's rich music history, it's great to see these vintage items. The Beatles suites are here among hundreds of other props."
1048,30 November 2014,30,was ok,Service was ok food a bit over priced compared to other hard rock cafes but worth a visit to the shop if you collect hard rock items.
1049,27 November 2014,30,Average Hard Rock Restaurant,"It is just like every other Hard Rock Cafe. If you've seen one, you've seen this one. Food and service were not bad but it was nothing extravagant. I would recommend going to a restaurant you can only find in NY and not a chain."

1061,3 November 2014,30,Usual Hardrock,"Poor service, mediocre food, place could do with a good tidy up and some sort of system would help. But it's Hard Rock so will always attract, until you get in and have to wiat for service"

1078,1 October 2014,50,Worth a Wait,We love all of the Hard Rock Cafe's. The food was good and worth the wait for NYC. Price is higher in Manhattan than our home area of Phoenix and the wait was worth the half hour time to get seated.

1083,19 September 2014,40,yummy wings,"loved the wings - seasoned and not ""just hot"". the bruschetta was good too, large pieces of toast with a generous helping of fresh tomatoes, etc. Service was good - not too pushy, available when needed."
1084,17 September 2014,30,Good food,"The food was good and the place was typical hard rock. The service from our hostess was not so good though, it seemed to us that she was a bit tired of her job, which made the hole experience average."

1092,5 September 2014,30,Try it once,It was ok and nice to say I had been there but nothing special could get better food else where. Service was ok but not great
1093,2 September 2014,10,Will not return,The service and food were extremely poor. They ran out of ice while we were there. Service was slow. Shake was a WASTE of money. Very little shake or alcohol. Hamburger was average tasting. Do not waste your time here.
1094,2 September 2014,40,Hamburger Heaven,The hamburgers were wonderful. A wide selection. All around $ 16.00 which included fries. The decorations from so many musicians are fascinating and keep the kids busy and entertained.

1100,29 August 2014,30,Overpriced and distinctly average,Overpriced and distinctly average food only made up for by the setting and the great music mementos inside and out. Much better places than this around.

1102,28 August 2014,50,Speedy seating & service!,"Following reviews posted previously we left with plenty time before our show however there was no wait at all! We were seated immediately, all the staff were polite & friendly. The food was great as at every Hard Rock Cafe we have visited!"
1103,27 August 2014,50,Gorgeous food and great atmosphere,Brilliant service - there was a queue in which we had to wait to be seated but it was worth the wait! Not overly expensive either - but its not about price if your in new York.. its the experience :)

1109,12 August 2014,50,Good lunch,"Both the burger, the salad, the drinks and the waiter were doing a very good job. It is not the cheapest place to eat, but you do get a lot in return, including atmosphere."
1110,10 August 2014,50,Great lunch!,"Our first restaurant in NYC, it was a very neat place to go. In the heart of Time Square, very busy place! The food was great and the staff was very friendly!"

1115,5 August 2014,40,Typical Hard Rock,Standard Hard Rock experience. Decent food and decor. Crowded but that is to be expected given it's in Times Square and it's summer in NYC. Great if your just looking for a good chain restaurant.

1121,27 July 2014,40,Average Hard Rock.,Food was typical Hard Rock - usual American favorites. The Hard Rock 'store' is street level and you have to walk downstairs for restaurant seating. Very dark and dim. Good bar service. The food quality/seasoning was very good so gave high marks.

1182,5 March 2014,40,"Ok food, but excellent service","The food was ok, tipical of casual dinners. But the service was excellent, made us feel very welcomed. As for waiting time, it is times square so you probably going to have to wait. But in my experience i didn't have a long waiting time."
1183,28 February 2014,40,Very good food.,Was sceptical before hand thinking this would be all show and no substance. How mistaken I was the starters were so huge we struggled to eat the main courses.
1184,16 February 2014,50,Perfect experience,"After our dismal experience at Planet Hollywood we were slightly concerned about eating here... these were completely unfounded. It was great. Lovely staff, good atmosphere, great food and a truly NYC experience. Would go back again"
1185,16 February 2014,40,Buffet Breakfast,"Called in on a very cold morning for a hot breakfast buffet. Fresh food, although not a huge choice, efficient service and certainly didn't feel rushed (although difficult to believe you ever would on a cold February morning.)"

1188,8 February 2014,40,"Good food, great location",Good food at a reasonable price and a great location on Times Square. Music wasn't too loud which is a good thing if you ask me.
1189,8 February 2014,40,Not bad!,"When you go to any Hard Rock Cafe, you expect a level of it being over commercial. The service, food and drinks however were good and the food was reasonably priced. We had to have a repeat visit as it was enjoyed so much."
1190,6 February 2014,50,Fun fun fun,So many historic things to see and the staff were excellent. The food and drinks were amazing as well and we got a lot of food for our money.

1195,16 January 2014,30,Food was okay - wouldn't return,"Standard fare... Although nothing in particular wrong with food, unless visiting for novelty value when in NYC eat elsewhere! Not the usual Hard Rock vibe"
1196,11 January 2014,30,Food not good but very entertaining.,"Ordered the jumbo combo & a salad, the jumbo combo was colder than the salad. The bartender was very entertaining and all of the Hard Rock Cafe decorations were very nice."
1197,8 January 2014,30,not worth the wait,good atmosphere but food very rushed and very average not worth the wait - tried 3 days to get in Plant Hollywood much better
1198,8 January 2014,40,yum,"100% better than over the road at Planet Hollywood. Music better, food better, service better, everything better. Grabbed a bargain as well due to having 30% off at the time. Would love to visit again and stay longer"

1204,30 December 2013,40,As expected from a hard rock,The food Is great can't really go wrong as it's the same menu every where. Service was good but not great. It seamed to be a bit unorganised when you first arrive and are waiting to be seated.
1205,28 December 2013,40,Well worth a visit,Iconic restaurant in an iconic area. Great food and friendly service and some interesting memorabilia in this New York branch. Loved the burger and enjoyed the ambience

1210,21 December 2013,40,Excellent atmosphere but remortgage the house!,"A long queue for tables with an hour wait - not surprising. The food was excellent and plentiful, the service very polite and efficient but VERY expensive for burger and chips!"
1211,20 December 2013,50,"Re-Visited, delicious","Once again the Hard Rock NYC did not disappoint, great food and extremely good service. Would recommend this for anyone visiting New York."
1212,17 December 2013,30,Disappointed,Very disappointed this time round - food came out freezing cold (twice) both the starter and the mains Hopefully was just a blip as have eaten at other hard rock cafés and never had an issue before the food is normally good!
1213,17 December 2013,50,"Quick Service, Good Food",We had an early dinner and was able to get immediate sitting at the bar. Staff was friendly and attentive. Pricing was fair based on where we are. I would definitely come back!
1214,14 December 2013,20,Waste of time (and lots of it),"Went with our three kids. Waited in line for about forty five minutes. When we finally made it in, service was so-so. Food was more greasy and diner-level. All in all - would not go again, in spite of the nice decor and atmosphere."
1215,10 December 2013,30,Good fun,"Went one evening, was fairly busy and a fun, upbeat atmosphere. Love all the memorabilia and music. Food was ok and the service not too bad, it was pretty busy but the waiter was good fun."

1218,28 November 2013,30,Go for the ambiance,Servers were nice but service was a bit slow. Food was average. Memorabilia was the best part of the place. Get there early to beat the lines.
1219,23 November 2013,40,Good Foods,"Four of us went to The Hard Rock at Time Square, good experience, good food . Everyone enjoyed the night out and also the desert was great."
1220,17 November 2013,40,Nice to try....,"We went when in New York out of curiosity. To go to the various/restaurant you must go downstairs. For drunks only you must sit around the bar. It is dark inside with lots of bright lights, but a good atmosphere with drinks reasonably priced."
1221,10 November 2013,50,One of the best restaurants in NYC.,"Wonderful atmosphere, awesome food and very welcoming staff. One of the best places in New York. I'll certainly be back!"
1222,3 November 2013,50,great burgers,Times Square-Hard Rock Cafe in october 2013. The hamburgers were delicious. The waiting time for a table 20 mins but so worth it.
1223,30 October 2013,20,!,Two rounds of drinks $60! No wonder the drinks menu doesn't have prices on. Food was OK though but nothing special.
1224,24 October 2013,50,Great time,"Perfect restaurant, fun and great food. Had a variety of food even for vegetarians and the energy was great. Lots of entertainment and all the waiters and waitresses were always happy. The meals were really big though for someone from the UK!!"
1225,23 October 2013,20,Not your typical H. Rock experience car,"I've been to many around the world and for a great city like NY, I'd expected a little bit more 'bang'! Mild music, under-welmed by the service and mood in the place!"

One drink walking around enjoying all the Elton John costumes, many guitars,pictures & motorcycles. Lots of things and people to look at. Did not eat. But this was an interesting stop along the way."
1228,16 October 2013,50,Tasty..but overpriced,"The food was lovely, yet somewhat overpriced. Considering the size of portions you can get in other restaurants for half the price then its not as good as what people make out. The food if decent though."
1229,6 October 2013,40,Massive portions!!,"Fun atmosphere, excellent service, delicious food and drinks!! Slight wait to be seated, as to be expected!! Portions here are huge, so we did waste a fair bit of food!! Going back in Jan 2014 and this is on our list to visit again!!!"

1233,19 September 2013,40,Like all other Hard Rocks,"If you know what a Hard Rock Café is like, this is the same. Their store is worth a stop at even if you don't eat there because they have nice pins unique to NYC that are always changing and updating. Convenient to Times Square."
1234,19 September 2013,50,Good Food and Service,Had lunch there as I was told it was an original building however it has been updated. Typical hard rock care.
1235,12 September 2013,30,Not very special.,"We have been in Hard Rock Cafes all around the world and was expecting the one in NYC to be quite special. We were disappointed in the memorabilia, and the food was only average. Would not bother again."

1244,30 August 2013,50,School Trip,"I went here in June 2012 on a school trip and its a trip that I will deinitely never forget. The atmosphere was brilliant and the staff were really nice, they even took pictures with us. I would highly recommend this place!"

1250,24 August 2013,30,Decent food and service!,"The kids wanted to try this one because they had never been to this location. Everything was just average in both food and service. We were there pretty late so perhaps the time has something to do with it. In a pinch, worth the time."
1251,22 August 2013,50,Good atmosphere,"This famous café proposed unforgettable atmosphere, tasty dishes, good service and unexpectable reasonable prices. We were 5 hungry adults and finished with drinks and fully loaded at about 120$."

1374,2 October 2012,40,Good hamburgers and Eccellent sandwich,We stayed in NY four days and went twice to HR Cafe. Always had great hamburgers and an excellent Texas Sandwich. Service very friendly but may be too much inclined towards gratuities.
1375,28 September 2012,30,A family place in the middle of Broadway,"Decent food, but not great. Fair prices, kid friendly. Altogether a decent place for a quick lunch in the theater district."
1376,26 September 2012,30,Pretty good breakfast buffet,"Server was rushed you could tell, but did a good job. Eggs were a bit runny but the pancake dippers and sausages we're good. 40 bucks for breakfast is a bit steep tho."

1388,30 August 2012,40,The Best Burger anywhere!,"First night in New York? Go to Times Square after a beer in Bryant Park and go to the Hard Rock Cafe. Its Legendary Burger is unbeatable - beautifully cooked rare burger with home-fries and salad, great value for your $15."

1391,23 August 2012,30,Not impressed,"The service was great, but the food was mediocre at best. Very disappointing. It was so chilly in the restaurant that we couldn't wait to get outside. If you like fast food, a chilly environment then this is the place for you."
1392,17 August 2012,30,good place for a drink,good place right at the edge of times square to get a drink and always a great place to see all the people.
1393,15 August 2012,30,"Even If You Visit Only Once, Visit","Its loud, its pricey and the food is just above average but its Hard Rock Cafe Times Square New York. Obviously a must for fans of certain genres of music and music memorabilia but some of the exhibits will astound non music memorabilia fans."
1394,15 August 2012,40,Never fails to please- Times Square Branch,I eat at Hard Rocks everywhere as I like the fact that I know hat I am getting. My favorite meal is the pulled pork sandwich. The brand standard of this restaurant chain is second to none.
1395,13 August 2012,40,Fun!,Went here as a family. Food prices were as expected and not that outrageous. A family of 4 cost approx. $80 and that included alcohol and a glass to take home. The food was very good and the portion sizes were huge!
1396,13 August 2012,30,Broadway Prices,Food was ok and drinks were expensive. Very large but not very clean. Good if you are in a rush and want a place to feed the kids near the the theatre district.
1397,6 August 2012,40,Pin Man was Awesome,"The restaurant is your typical Hard Rock but our server, ""The Pin Man"" was awesome. A little pricey for ""bar food"" though. We were seated rather quickly and our server was very responsive to all our needs."
1398,25 July 2012,50,Cool and nice food,"The California burger was awesome, and the drinks as well! Worth a visit. For only 10 dollars you get a souvenir glass (included drink) as well!"

1401,24 July 2012,40,Good Times - always,The food was good. Staff was (as usual) quite attentive and helpful. They even arranged a Birthday Sundae for our group leader who was celebrating a birthday.
1402,24 July 2012,40,Nice restaurant while in NYC with family,"Kids love this place when we are in NYC, lots a fun items to looks at, and in the middle of Times Square"
1403,23 July 2012,30,Average,"Meal was ok but wife's chicken was undercooked. Your really paying for the name and location. Better to find elsewhere and less crowded, especially with people walking around looking at the walls."

1408,15 July 2012,50,Typical Hard Rock Cafe,We have visited many Hard Rock Cafes. I think they pretty much are all the same. We make it a point to visit if there is one near our destination. We enjoy collecting HRC tshirts and pins.
1409,12 July 2012,50,Love the place,How could one not love this place Always a seat at the bar Great service and music Convenient restrooms
1410,10 July 2012,50,Great times and great food.,"Service was great, food always good, and great music, atmosphere. Great for the entire family at lunch or dinner. We happen to eat there 2 days out of 4 day trip, and the kids loved it."

1418,25 June 2012,40,Tasty but a little pricey,We ordered the steak which was delicious although a tad pricey. It was also a bit loud compared to the other hard rock cafes we've visited. Interesting layout in an old theater
1419,24 June 2012,40,Like any other in the world,"Nice decoration. Liked the guitars in the wall when you get downstairs. Good food...but the chicken fingers were soooo spicy I could barely eat them! They have to improve their cocktails...worst mojito ever, but loved the Southern Rock."
1420,24 June 2012,30,OK,"Not the best HardRock I have been in Orlando the best - service good - food average, surroundings poor"
1421,20 June 2012,50,Great breakfast buffet,"We were surprised how few people eat breakfast there. Not the greatest food, but good value and plenty of it. Plus you get the place to yourself to wander round and look at the memorabilia."
1422,19 June 2012,40,Memorabilia haven - great music,"Wait staff was attentive. Food was better than expected, we were there for a light lunch. A little of a wait but the climb up the stairs had lots to look at."
1423,18 June 2012,50,Really Great!,"I'm not crazy about branch restaurants, but I'm pleased with my visits this Hard Rock. I have no complaints at all about this location. Everything meet my very high standards."
1424,16 June 2012,30,Went more for the brand and not for the food,Maybe i assumed that it was going to be something greater than it was. You're paying for the chain food brand but not for the food....
1425,16 June 2012,40,like,I love going into this place for a look around especially the massive guitar on the ceiling
1426,13 June 2012,50,Best cocktail and service ever!,"While we were in NY, we went at least 6 or 7 times out of 10 nights. They definitely make the best cocktails and the staff is incredibly sweet and helpful."
1427,12 June 2012,30,Not too impressed,No queue and went straight in. The air conditioning was way to low and it was freezing. Our waitress was very good though and tried hard to please. The food was average and the atmosphere was lacking. Have been in better Hard Rock cafes.
1428,12 June 2012,30,Corporate Private Event,"Large space for a private event, food stations were average."
1429,1 June 2012,40,Fun to Go to,"We love the NYC Hard Rock. It is VERY popular with tourists. Go early, or you will have a long wait. The food is expensive and fairly good. My teens like the music memorabilia, displays and music videos playing."

1578,16 August 2019,40,Not bad,Visited here with my son whilst on a break for his birthday. Prices reasonable compared to some NY prices and service was extremely good. We booked in advance so we did not have to wait. Thoroughly enjoyed. Nachos were fab.
1579,19 August 2019,50,Fun Environment!,"My dd wanted a restaurant with lots screens and music. We chose the correct place! We quickly made an Open Table reservation and we were seated in front of the giant big screen immediately. Now, some of the videos were not good for children, but...More"
1580,18 August 2019,40,Mainly a good experience,"We had pre-booked for our daughters birthday whilst on holiday, and were warmly greeted when we arrived and my daughter was given the guitar to hold in the family pic, unfortunately the lady who showed us to our table looked and acted like she would rather have been somewhere else.  Luckily our server was great, food was good and arrived in a timely manner. Not the cheapest of places to eat, but was on a par with most other places."
1581,18 August 2019,40,Good,This Hard Rock is as good as any other Hard Rock. Staff were friendly. Food was a bit too spicy for our tastes but good. Prices as expected not over the top.
1582,17 August 2019,50,Amazing as always!,"During our visit to New York we visited Hard Rock Cafe twice, on our first visit I booked prior for ‪7:30pm‬ so we did not have to queue however I heard others mention the wait was 1 hour 30 minutes if you had not booked, on our second visit we arrived ‪around 5pm‬ and there was no queue at all, we was taken straight to a table. The food is great as always, cooked to perfection and full of taste. I highly recommend the BBQ Steak burger I also highly recommended the alcoholic milkshakes"
1583,17 August 2019,40,One of the best HRCs in the world,"Good food at reasonable prices (compared to NY City standards). Very big place, we did not have to wait for a table on either of our 2 visits. We really appreciate the gluten free options, staff knows what they need to know! I may be wrong but they seem to have less veggie options than other HRCs we have visited"
1584,16 August 2019,40,Not bad,Visited here with my son whilst on a break for his birthday. Prices reasonable compared to some NY prices and service was extremely good. We booked in advance so we did not have to wait. Thoroughly enjoyed. Nachos were fab.
1585,15 August 2019,40,Good reaction against a problem,I went with my daughters and due to communication problems our meal arrived with more than an hour delay. We ask some waiters but no answer. Finally the restaurant manager came to apologize and we did not pay the bill. A great answer from Hard Rock. I use to visit the restaurants around the world and always satisfy.
1586,12 August 2019,30,Avoid the burgers,"So if I were to go again I would avoid the burgers and straight fry, the frys with cheese, bacon and spring onions are much nicer. Everyone else in the party had things other than burgers and theirs was nicer than mine. Puddings....2 between 4 would have been enough.... no breakfast tomorrow for me! Pretty cool stuff round the walls and it is worth booking in advance or you will wait in a queue. All in all good but not brilliant, also expensive, but that is New York."
1587,11 August 2019,10,terrible,"We stopped here for quick drink or 2 while visiting NYC for the Iron Maiden concert. Very rushed and because we only wanted a drink sitting anywhere was a problem with the staff, eventually was allowed to sit at a bar at the side where we had the pleasure of sitting near a stinking waste bin. The music that was being being played was a joke considering the name of the place.We will stick to the Irish bars in the future.Rock fans need to give this a wide birth."
1588,10 August 2019,40,Enjoyable experience,"Having booked online, we were straight away taken to our table - after the photo ($25 to keep, no thanks!)  Service was quick for a place that size and for a large Budweiser it was $7, which is a decent price for NY.  The portions were large and tasty. We gas the Combo and pork sandwich. Worth a go."
1589,8 August 2019,40,Best Hard Rock,I have visited a few Hard Rocks before and not too impressed but this one was very good. Some great memorabilia on display then good food and great service. Enjoyable.

1968,3 January 2017,30,Slow service,"Had breakfast here, took ages for our orders to be taken despite the restaurant not being busy. The food however was good and the location is great"
1969,2 January 2017,10,Bad service,I'm drinking a moskow mule at the bar right now. Very bad service. The drink is on the average of nothing. No tip for the guy. He doesn't even say hello to us.
1970,2 January 2017,50,Very cool place to visit,This is like a mini music museum. We had a good dinner but found it to be a bit pricey for what you get. Otherwise our service was great and we just had fun looking at all of the memorabilia.
1971,2 January 2017,50,Celebrating my sons 18th bday today 1st Jan,"They told us a wait for 1.30 mins, we decided to wait, only waited 45mins, the meal was lovely, best meal I've had all holiday, felt very sorry for waitress she had started at 10.30 am til 1.00pm crazy. Great place, reasonable"
1972,30 December 2016,20,Ok....,Nothing spectacular! Service was rather slow and when ordering the large pulled chicken burger. Came on a tiny plate and was cold. Not really impressed for the price. Such as shame as was really looking forward to going here!
1973,30 December 2016,50,Great Ambience,Rocking ambience. The food wasn't the huge portions that I expected it to be. They were small and average tasting burgers. Although the chocolate molten cake was scrumptious & it simply melts in your mouth!
1974,30 December 2016,50,Good atmosphere and service,"Although the restaurant was busy we were seated promptly (they told us 1/2 hr but buzzed in 5 minutes). Good food, large portions, I was full with a starter, good service and overall a great restaurant."

1977,29 December 2016,50,Love this place,"Our ""table friend"" was Jonathan who made our night just perfect. He went out of his way to attend to our needs and nothing was too much. The food was lovely, atmosphere spot on and service amazing. Would most definitely recommend."
1978,27 December 2016,40,Good,"I'm not a lover of Hard Rock but i found that place so full of music history, as should be every Hard Rock! I have drank only a beer so i can't judge food but i liked service, it was very kind and funny!"
1979,24 December 2016,40,Always a good time!,"We dipped in here on a cold Friday night because the waiting area is inside. Awesome memorabilia everywhere. We were seated on about 35 minutes, great service and food was good. I would have rated 5 but our appetizer was lukewarm. Cool experience"
1980,22 December 2016,40,Great atmosphere,"This was one of our first eats on our first trip to NYC. Staff were friendly and food was fairly quick to come out. Ate Mozzarella Sticks and Chicken Strips, washed down with a few beers! Establishment was clean, no complaints from us."
1981,18 December 2016,50,Great,The atmosphere was great spent time looking at the exhibits on show. The food was brilliant and the cocktails were to die for!!!!!! We went there twice for our evening meals and once for breakfast in our weeks stay in New York.
1982,17 December 2016,30,Lunch with tourist friends,The food is average. You go more for the atmosphere and the name. The burgers and fries are good. It's a tourist thong to do.
1983,17 December 2016,20,Deception,"We visited because of the fame and the decoration is really nice, but the food, you have multiple better options around. The price, was disprportionated. We won't repeat."
1984,16 December 2016,40,good atmosphere but bit of a wait for tables,"Food and service were good, prices a bit high, but we knew that going in. loved to see the memorabilia."
1985,13 December 2016,50,Can't not do Hard Rock!,"Just go there...it might be a wait for the table but just go. Food is great, atmosphere is superb and as a Hard Rock experience can't be faulted!"
1986,8 December 2016,40,Great way to finish a perfect stay with the last night meal at the hard rock,Great food the staff were so help full food was. So good the soda was refilled as you eat just part of the service Food tasted so good with a great back ground it made the last night so good
1987,8 December 2016,40,Nice place,"We came inn a little bit late before closing time. But they fixed good food inn noen time. Nice people, good food, clean place and clean restroom."
1988,8 December 2016,30,"very good music (of course) nice staff, bu slow service, average food","every ""hard rock cafe"" is an experience, this one is it too. The waiters and waitresses are very kind and ""cool"", but the service takes a long time. The food was average but OK. Pretty expensive for what you get."
1989,7 December 2016,30,Not the best Hard Rock Cafe that I have visited,Visited this restaurant on my recent trip to New York found the food very average had the hard rock burger and fries which had little taste will probably not return here again
1990,7 December 2016,30,"December 7, 2016",Ate here for lunch today. Wasn't very busy but the service was just mediocre. Very few visits from our waitress. Food was ok.
1991,6 December 2016,10,Stick to the gift shop,"If you want to wait for a while then pay too much for a mediocre burger in really cool looking very crowded surroundings then this is the spot for you. Otherwise focus on the gift shop, buy a Hard Rock pin then head for McDonalds."
1992,5 December 2016,30,Had to visit,"It's a little old and odd inside with low ceilings, a true basement bar. Service with bartender Pandora was great."

1994,3 December 2016,40,Good version of this restaurant,"Had a good all around experience at this restaurant. The service was good. The staff was fast, friendly and willing to help. The food was very good and delivered fast."
1995,29 November 2016,50,Tourist haven,The Hard Rock in midtown is very cool and has great memorabilia. The food and drink are typical of all Hard Rocks and was ok...nothing special there. New York pricing though! Fun. Would recommend for the box to be checked.
1996,28 November 2016,10,Poor servixe,"Group of 6, bad service, bad food!!!! Burger was dry, and took ages for drinks to come!!! No flavour in any food"
1997,28 November 2016,40,Great experience,"First time in NYC and came here twice, beer was good, wings were good (took a while to come) but Michelle was an awesome server which is why I came back. Definitely worth a visit when in Times Square"
1998,26 November 2016,50,Awesome. Big portions,Good atmosphere and the staff were all very welcoming and fun. We had a starter and main and wow the starters are huge! The cocktails are great and the cup is a brilliant merchandise to keep.
1999,26 November 2016,40,Cool Place with good American Food.,Went here for lunch and had a great burger and shake. They have some cool stuff in this location and it is not uncommon to see rockers there having a bite.
2000,26 November 2016,50,Prompt but cold,We hadnt booked and was seated within 10mins. Food was of a good standard as always. Only complaints.... lower 'deck' was cold and finished plates were taken away before everyone was finished. Maybe this is English politeness to wait until everyone has finished.
2001,24 November 2016,50,Good food and friendly staff,"As any Hard Rock Cafe around the world, it has a great atmosphere and friendly staff. It will be a good choice if you're looking for late dinner since they close @ 1:00 am"

2003,23 November 2016,30,Slow bar service,"We stopped for a drink. Took forever to get service, even though the bar wasn't crowded. We only ordered drinks, so the waitress wasn't attentive. 2 cokes & 1 tequila was $23. Very large place."
2004,22 November 2016,40,Great eats!,Great food - lots of choices and great service. Be prepared to wait - very popular spot. Use the time to take pics with memorabilia or see Times Square.

2009,14 November 2016,20,Nice store crappy food.,Terrible food. Chicken was rubber. The nachos were soggy. One of our friends had to send the plate back. They did take off the cost of the meal.
2010,13 November 2016,50,You know what to expect,"You know what to expect, since it's the Hard Rock Cafe, but it was as really a great experience. Loved my juicy legendary local burger and the Long Island ice tea was a new discovery. Had fun, a great time and great food."
2011,8 November 2016,50,Great Atmosphere,We just dropped in for a beer - which cost us $20 for 2. We did however take in the atmosphere and all the guitars displayed were amazing. We also bought a tee-shirt for our nephew in the shop on our way out!

2176,18 May 2016,20,Disappointing,"Very disappointing visit to HRC. Food was lukewarm and the same burger cost $4 more than the Philadelphia restaurant. Service was poor, no atmosphere and even the music was mediocre. We always got to HRC on city breaks but we won't be going back."

2182,9 May 2016,30,Maybe too much going on,Sat at the bar. The bartender was pleasant enough but it took a while to get his attention. Decided to split a burger. The burger was well prepared but the fries were soggy. The place is massive but the experience should not be subpar.

2220,30 March 2016,40,Extra-cool,"I always remember it with a smile. Excellent food, good music, greatful atmosphere, waitresses always funny and careful about the clients!"
2221,28 March 2016,20,Way Overpriced! Food so so,"If you wanna drop $130 for lunch, then this is the place! This place is way overpriced and the food is below average to average. Flip side is, servers are super nice"
2222,28 March 2016,40,Busy,Very busy but plenty of memorabilia to look at while your waiting. If you are looking for some where quiet and don't like loud music this is not the place for you.
2223,24 March 2016,30,Portions too small!,The food quality was quite good but the portion size was a bit too small for my liking and they also got my order wrong. The theming was good and it carried through the whole restaurant.
2224,20 March 2016,40,Give it a go,"Very busy place get there before 6 pm if u don't want to wait. Big meals not to expensive and drinks reasonable,food good choice and good quality ."
2225,20 March 2016,50,Nice dinner. Lively atmosphere.,"Nice dinner, lively atmosphere, everything you'd expect from a hard rock cafe, yes it was busy but we never felt rushed, good service and food was well presented. Crushed berry cocktail is recommended is you want a refreshing drink."
2226,19 March 2016,30,What You Expect From Hard Rock,"The food at this location is like everything else ""New York""... Expensive!! The menu and loud, rock atmosphere is much like what you expect at any Hard Rock Cafe. I try to visit them everywhere we travel, but they are predictable."
2227,19 March 2016,20,"Food was predictable, and service wasn't great",Same food as other locations but predictable and good for families. Our server wasn't at all on top of our needs. Mains were served before we were doe with our appetizers. Drinks were gone and we had to ask the manager about getting more.
2228,18 March 2016,10,Horrendous service and attitude at host stand,"Terrible experience, went in at midnight, host said closed people dining, asked if open till 1am as advertised and posted, she said they are still closed. Will never go to Hard Rock again."
2229,15 March 2016,40,Its Hard Rock,"I Like Hard rock cafe, but must admit new york's restaurant is a bit crowded, with long lines. But it is hard Rock, and its always an excellente place to share with friends and to drink Large margueritas!"
2230,14 March 2016,40,Always good Cocktails!,Stopped for a quick lunch and drink. Excellent Nachos as always! Cocktails a little disappointing on this occasion.
2231,13 March 2016,30,Not the best Hard Rock,The waiting staff were really good however the food was pretty average. The ribs didn't have a lot of meat on them. Drinks were pretty good. Couldn't beat the location and decor.
2232,13 March 2016,40,Great!,This is another must do in NYC - such a large venue and a great atmosphere. The food is 'ok'. A bit mass produced and bland but I guess you shouldn't expect everything from this place. Great for families and couples.
2233,10 March 2016,40,First food stop,We enjoyed our meal here. The restaurant was clean and employees professional and courteous. If you have been to a Hard Rock anywhere else then this one is no different. The food was very good. And prepared as we ordered. No complaints. Would go again.
2234,9 March 2016,30,Average food,I am sure this restaurant can serve better meals that I've got. And actually the atmosphere is not bad at all. But my hamburger felt a but synthetic.
2235,8 March 2016,40,A must stop,"Very consistent for the quality of the service, food and drink. One of the best HRC for sure. Nicely decorated. Never come to NYC without stopping there for a drink or a meal!"
2236,7 March 2016,30,Good standby,Place was busy but service was quick and friendly. Typical chain food restaurant. Cool memorabilia though.
2237,4 March 2016,50,I love HRC!,I love the Hard Rock Cafe! Burgers were great. Service was perfect--very friendly and attentive! Always fun.
2238,3 March 2016,40,Great food !,"Quick service,great food,polite and friendly staff. Very dark inside this restaurant which made it just a little depressing, music in here is really loud too so it's not really a place I'd take elderly people to, however the food was very good !"
2239,3 March 2016,30,Not worth the money,"With a typical Hard Rock Cafe atmosphere, the service is not great and the food doesn't have the expected quality. The hamburger was dry."
2240,29 February 2016,40,it's a must do for Rock fans,"when you are in New York and you are a rock fan, you have to visit the Hardrock Cafe. There is always a waiting line, but the food is good and also the drinks. and finally you have to buy the newest Hardrock T-shirts ;-)"
2241,27 February 2016,40,A good chain restaurant,Having visited many Hard Rocks this one was not a lot different from the other. Like all the others I have visited the service is good and food very nice. This restaurant is in Times Square so can get very busy.
2242,27 February 2016,30,Good nachos and drinks .,Good Nachos and drinks .Cool atmosphere too . Very busy all the time . Service was not great but not poor either .
2243,24 February 2016,30,Evening meal,"Quick service, reasonable priced for location. Cheesecake amazing. Food was good apart from no bbq sauce in my bbq burger?"
2244,22 February 2016,50,Good service - as your would expect,"We visited as we have many other branches, good food, drink and service and pretty reasonable. A good safe bet for a bite to eat."
2245,22 February 2016,40,Great food / great atmosphere,"The restaurant was very busy but after the edit it was worth it . Great music , great food and atmosphere . Best local themed restaurant ."
2246,21 February 2016,40,Excellent experience for rock lovers,"Excellent experience for rock lovers. The food is good and you get the chance of seeing The New Creatures, Brian Jones' teardrop guitar, the original Abbey Road door and other memorabilia."
2247,20 February 2016,30,Nothing Great,My teenage daughters and I walked in one freezing cold January night after taking a nighttime bus tour. It was cozy warm and the wait only about 20 minutes. The food was okay but nothing great. The staff was friendly enough.
2248,20 February 2016,50,flatbread,"Stopped in for a quick appetizer, we shared a Margherita Flatbread f , it was so delicious. Service was great, not overpriced."
2249,19 February 2016,50,Better than expected,Food was fantastic but portions are massive. Make sure when ordering desserts that you check whether it's for sharing or not! Service was great also.
2250,17 February 2016,50,Consistently brilliant,"Came here with my husband and 2 friends. All of us had cocktails and food, both of which were amazing! The service was brilliant and I thoroughly enjoyed my time here! A must when in NYC"
2251,17 February 2016,20,Overrated,This is a popular place for the very young teenage crowd. The wait time is a bit nuts especially for this type of restaurant!!!
2252,17 February 2016,40,good food,"they have good food, burger, steak, fries, and some drinks. The one i dont like is the waiting. I understand the restaurant is in tourist place."
2253,17 February 2016,10,if you like hair in your nachos,"extremely slow service , the food was good but we found a hair in our food !!! that usually ruins the show ."
2254,16 February 2016,40,One of the better HRC,Late lunch with a 20 minute wait was OK. Our waiter Timothy did our order in his head and everything arrived as ordered after a short wait. It was great to leave a HRC without my ears bleeding - good style
2255,14 February 2016,50,"GREAT LOCATION, HUGE PORTIONS, LOVELY STAFF","We popped in here for late lunch last Monday. Great atmosphere, lovely food, staff very friendly. Menu varied as you would expect, portion sizes HUGE."
2256,13 February 2016,50,Wow,"The best burger I have EVER had. When they ask how you'd like it cooked you get an idea, but nothing prepares you. Insanely good!! Nom Nom"
2257,12 February 2016,50,Can't go wrong with Hard Rock,"This is the most impressive Hard Rock restaurant in terms of size, staff, food and memorabilia. We always go to Hard Rock because you know you'll have a great meal with great atmosphere."
2258,10 February 2016,50,The best Restaurant I have ever been to,Coming from New Zealand when I am lucky enough to visit New York I always ask if I can be taken to the Hard Rock Café for dinner. Being a huge music fan it really makes me so happy
2259,9 February 2016,50,Memories of a lifetime,"The food, the ambiance, the music, the legacy.. well this place has everything of course. I enjoyed some fine drinks along with salmon, and will remember the good time forever.."
2260,8 February 2016,40,Hard rock care Times square NYC,"Typical Hard Rock, decent food , good atmosphere, can get very busy but always found a bsr seat. Great location, bit pricey but it is Times Square."

2262,7 February 2016,30,It's the name,"Over the top. Friendly (too ....) staff, it is the name this place is populair. Food is not bad, but the magic (if it ever has been there) is gone, better spend your dollars in an other restaurant"
2263,6 February 2016,30,Not what I expected,"We have never been before and was disappointed , felt very dark and no atmosphere. Maybe it's out of season or a bit early in the day, not sure. We had a coffee and left. The staff were very welcoming and friendly."
2264,31 January 2016,40,Consistent,"Been to Hard Rock in USA, Canada and Europe. All pretty much the same. Times Square location is conveniently located in the middle of everything. If you are a fan of Hard Rock this location will not disappoint."
2265,31 January 2016,50,Service great!,Allan rocks! We went in for drinks and appetizer! Allan was super friendly and gave us some great tips on seeing the city! Relaxed atmosphere!
2266,30 January 2016,40,Can't go wrong with Hard Rock Cafe,"Really enjoyed the food as always! Cool venue in an old theatre. Food was good, service was friendly. Great location too."

2268,21 January 2016,30,It was the only restaurant open,"which is hard to believe in Times Square. We were actually the last people to be able to order food. I just got a salad, it was ok. I wouldn't choose to eat here, but the staff was nice and we could eat!"

2273,18 January 2016,50,NYE at the HA\ard Rock,Got married on NYE in Times Square and had our Reception at the Hard Rock. We were treated like Rock Stars and couldn't have been more pleased to bring in the new year at this place!
2274,17 January 2016,50,Nice restaurant downtown,"Great location at times square. Good food, fast service. Prices are a bit expensive but i guess that is all over Manhattan. Recommended!"
2275,16 January 2016,40,Hard Rock,Was very much as expected very nice and great atmosphere Easy to find in Time Square and it is next to Bubba Gumps
2276,14 January 2016,40,good value,burgers burgers and more burgers. oh and Natchos reasonable value for money but the same as any other hard rock cafe in the world
2277,14 January 2016,30,Breakfast was tasty but it took AGES to arrive...,"Me and my boyfriend had breakfast here, I had French toast with bacon, he had some egg dish-the food was really enjoyable and it's a lovely venue, but we waited nearly 45 minutes after ordering to get the food. Pretty poor service."
2278,12 January 2016,50,Delicious Hamburgers,"As all Hard Rock cafes the enviroment is awesome. Service was excellent. We tried a Strawerry lemonade that was delicious. Overoll we were very satisfied with our lunch,"
2279,11 January 2016,30,Not the best but simple fare for tourists.,Went there after a late play for a burger. Burger was standard and nothing special but the fries were a little soggy. Typical price for NYC but better for a family as it is not above $$.
2280,9 January 2016,50,Asked for ID lol,Had cocktails here on our first night. The girl who served us asked me for ID Made my holiday and I had just arrived. Pricey but that's fair enough
2281,9 January 2016,10,Lunch,Did not enjoy food was not great Planet Hollywood was far better over priced for what it is Def will not return
2282,9 January 2016,50,exciting night,"Good food. lovely atmosphere.. loud good music..quick service..live music ..very good singers....long queue..a wide menu with many specialties..meat, cheese, pizzas..international food and good drinks."
2283,9 January 2016,40,What you expect from hard rock cafe,"My favourite Hard Rock Cafe from the many that I've been to. Situated in the middle of the Nathan of Times Square, the wait staff are very friendly and the food is quite decent."
2284,8 January 2016,50,Fantastic atmosphere,Great food and large choice of drinks. Brilliant atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and gave amazing customer service. Will be back again.
2285,8 January 2016,30,It's alright.,"I've never really seen the big deal with hard rock cafe personally. Its overpriced, completely targets tourists and isn't particularly great. This one did have a nice atmosphere to it though and service is fine, so I can't really complain in that respect."
2286,7 January 2016,50,BREAKFAST!!,"the breakfast.... one word OMG!"" all you can eat and really good queality deffo worth a drop in to grab something to eat before a big day"
2287,7 January 2016,50,Time Square Meal with music,"The bar is situated close Time Square, it serves nice food, great drinks and as usual in Hard Rock you are surrounded by a nice music."
2288,6 January 2016,20,Poor breakfast,"Wen't there for breakfast. For 20 bucks you get slow service, a list of few dishes to choose from and best of all you get to rewards this bad experience with 18% automatic gratuity. First disappointing visit to Hard Rock Cafe."
2289,6 January 2016,50,Excellent,"Lovely and enjoyable meal, true American food, cocktails were beautiful and our waitress was very nice and helpful! Enjoyed the photo when we first got there"
2290,6 January 2016,40,Huge portions!,Service toke quite a while but it was worth the time. Food is really good and high quality. Portions are huge. Waiters are friendly. But the beer I got wasn't too good tho. Overall of 4/5 stars. Hard Rock Cafe is never disappointing 👍🏻
2291,4 January 2016,40,good food with friendly service,family of four left feeling full. out the door under 100 dollars which we were very happy about. great location. Nice scenery and good music selection heard throughout our meal. would definitely return
2292,3 January 2016,40,"Great location, busy restaurant","Got in at the right time and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table, waiter didn't seem over interested and we got our starters at the same time as our mains, but the food was really good!"
2293,1 January 2016,50,Great food etc etc,"Had a great meal here a couple of days ago, lunch time, ribeye steak, cooked to perfection, good , fast service,you will not be disappointed here ."
2294,31 December 2015,50,Night in the city,Dinner was very good and service was terrific. Atmosphere was lively and fun! Great for family and / or groups.
2295,31 December 2015,40,Addicted,"I collect this guitar pins and have for 30 years, so it's a must stop. Food is always great and the staff in the shop is super helpful."
2296,30 December 2015,30,Chain eating on the Square,The food is average. The wait staff is good at first but it is difficult to get a refill. You may only want to go to say you are at Hard Rock on Times Square.
2297,30 December 2015,40,Noisy but nice friendly service,The noise prevented any conversation but the music and surrounding paraphernalia was entertaining. The food servings were massive and when we asked if smaller serves were available we were told that our request couldn't be accommodated. What a waste of food!
2298,29 December 2015,30,Don't go without a reservation,Smaller menu than other HRC locations but of course pricier. I think about 20% more than the last time I went in September in Boston.
2299,29 December 2015,30,Free with nyc passes,All I can say is iam glad it was free with our nyc passes . Very busy don't know what all the fuss is about food not great wouldn't go again disappointed really .
2300,28 December 2015,40,"Great restaurant, very compatible to all other Hard Rocks","Good service received here as can be expected from the HRC. Price is very reasonable given the environment and you don't feel rushed to finish your meal and get out. Located right on Times Square it's easy to find, however booking is definitely required!"
2301,28 December 2015,50,Very good!!,Very good restaurant!! very good service very good food the place is beatiful. Recommends to eat there
2302,28 December 2015,40,A truly Hard Rock Cafe in all its extent!,"A truly Hard Rock Cafe in all its extent! Great atmosphere, people from all over the world, great staff. Just take into account it gets very crowded."
2303,27 December 2015,40,"Great Food, friendly staff",Sat at the bar since it was a 30 min wait for the dining room. The bartender was extremely friendly and the food was good. A little pricy but expected for Times Square.
2304,23 December 2015,30,What experience am I paying for?,"Everybody says you should go to Hard Rock for the experience. After a fairly long wait, mediocre food, and an overpriced souvenir shop, I'm still confused as to what experience I invested in."
2305,23 December 2015,40,Pretty good,My husband and I ate here for drinks and lunch one day. The food was good and we tried 2 of their specialty cocktails. Both were good but neither were great. Pretty good place to grab a quick bite.
2306,21 December 2015,50,Bargain breakfast!,"We stumbled upon this for breakfast one morning, and were happily surprised! For $17, you got a huge breakfast, beverage and tip included! Great food, and great service! Right next to Times Square!"

2308,18 December 2015,30,Average Food/Questionable Family Environment,"Food was average, server was energetic and friendly but the videos being shown on the screens were not for young eyes. Probably not a chain I will be rushing back to."
2309,17 December 2015,50,"Great place, great food","Really enjoyed our meal, very reasonably priced and the atmosphere is fab. Servers really make the experience a memorable one. Book a table as soon as you can as it gets very very busy!"
2310,16 December 2015,40,"Great surroundings, ok food","The restaurant is exactly how one would envisage- glamorous, great atmosphere, really cashing in on its USP. The food was good but pretty blah, nothing too special. Definitely had an all-American feel to this place. Probably wouldn't go again though, having been the once."
2311,15 December 2015,40,Hard Rock NYC,"We went to Hard Rock for dinner. They said it would be 45 min. To an Hour wait, but it was only 20 min.. Our waitress was really great, and our food was really good."
2312,15 December 2015,40,Steak is amazing,"OMG! The steak was so good i couldnt finish it all. My only suggestion would be to ask for the next up of how you have it cooked at home, i asked for medium but it was more rare."
2313,15 December 2015,50,Amazing atmopshere as expected!,We stopped here for a few drinks and were able to sit at the bar. Loved the atmosphere and the service couldn't be faulted.
2314,14 December 2015,30,The restaurant was neat but food was blaaaa,The restaurant was a meet place but the food and service were pretty terrible. They butchered my order and did not fix it.Very busy because of the location and name but your definitely treated like just a number.

2318,30 November 2015,40,Great food and service,"No reservation on a very busy night but we managed to get a table for four. Waitress was very friendly and informative. Our drinks order came quick and food followed not long after that. Food was well presented, big portions and very tasty."
2319,29 November 2015,30,very poor services,"We waited ages to be served, other people came in after us and had their meals before we even got our drinks! The food was good when it eventually came though. The drinks are not great though"
2320,28 November 2015,40,An evening in Times Square,"Were seated very quickly by very friendly staff, who took an interest in us. Food upto the usual standard for Hard Rocks. Very wheelchair friendly."
2321,27 November 2015,40,Great food and service,"Typical Hard Rock.....managed to pre-book through open table and had a brilliant meal........Hard Rock never fail to deliver, great service as always!!!!!"

2323,26 November 2015,50,Great atmosphere in Times Square,"Really good food and lots of cool things to see in here. A little bit of a wait to get a table, but worth it once we got in. Great music too!"
2324,25 November 2015,30,Decent Food but Slow Service,"If you have been to a Hard Rock then this is the same experience as all of the others. Overall the food was good but the service was kind of slow, we waited over an hour to get our food."
2325,24 November 2015,40,"Nice place, nice food!",this place is very beautiful with a lots of table and a lots of people..but the service are fast and perfect! I advise you to eat Mexican burger... no words to describe....
2326,23 November 2015,50,Great service!,"Service at the Hard Rock in Times Square was great! We didn't know we would get a free glass with our drink and they told us we would when we got our bill. Food was great, had a great time!"
2327,23 November 2015,50,ANNES Birthday,Went here to celebrate my wife's Birthday . Booked a table beforehand. Excellant service excellant food . When I mentione it was my wife's birthday they put a candle in our shared ice cream ( Diabetic Nightmare) Pleasant surroundings good memorabilia on the walls.
2328,23 November 2015,50,Fab!,"Ate here last week while on holiday in NYC, Food was really nice, Cocktails were fab! Atmosphere was amazing... It's right on Times Square so a perfect dinner before heading off to a show in Broadway!"
2329,20 November 2015,40,You know what to expect...,I did visit many Hard Rock Cafe's worldwide and the concept is repeating and you don't get suprises. The menue is always Burgerish & Beerish and there is always a souvenier shop. Had a nice burger with beer and got treated very nicely.
2330,18 November 2015,30,Just ok,"Loved the venue and the memorabilia, food was just ok. Felt we were rushed from start to finish. Constantly pressurised for either photo,charity band purchase, glass etc. If you want a quick bite then it's suitable."
2331,18 November 2015,40,Ok place,Sat down quite quickly after being shown to our table. When the food was delivered it looked very nice. I could not eat all of it as it was a good portion.
2332,17 November 2015,30,Just like any other Hard Rock,Not the best eatery in town however if looking for a quick bite to eat this a good place to go. I do like the rock memorabilia - it is fun!
2333,15 November 2015,40,"Good Food, very vibrant","If you want a nice quiet romantic meal then HRC is not for you. The service was good, the food was good, but really noisy. Music and videos are playing all the time."

2335,9 November 2015,40,Great Atmosphere,"Typical Hard Rock experience, very loud, very busy !!!! Food at this venue was very good. have had not so good food at other HR restaurants."
2336,4 November 2015,40,"Good food, great place full of iconic items just as expected","Standard menu, we weren't disappointed, service was very nice! The collection is marvellous, I spent some time apologising to various groups in order to look at the items at their tables..."

2338,3 November 2015,40,Hard Rock Cafe of New York,"I highly recommend for steak and burgers enthusiasts. Solid cousin, maybe a little overpriced but still good food. Big dishes tasty. Nothing to complain."
2339,3 November 2015,40,As expected,"Chain with same menu, but good. Shopping also same as usual. Staff not helpful at all with same cramped store"
2340,3 November 2015,50,Fantastic!,"Always visit a Hard Rock where possible and this Hard Rock didn't disappoint. Great restaurant, food and service. Definitely worth a visit if in New York."

2342,1 November 2015,50,Fine taste,"Must visit when you are in time square,which is close place. Taste is not only the factor,but pleasing environment for dining. Like other places,this branch also established professional manner"
2343,31 October 2015,50,Great experience,"First visit to any Hard Rock Cafe. They didn't disappoint, the service and food was excellent. We had cocktails too which were really good. To top it off we saw David Baddiel but my wife was too chicken to say hello."
2344,30 October 2015,50,Good value for money,A typical Hard Rock Cafe situated in the middle of Times Square. Both food and drink were reasonably priced and tasted good. There was a really nice atmosphere and if you want to watch sport there is a large screen.
2345,30 October 2015,50,Great meal out,Wonderful atmosphere in a classic hard rock venue. Great food and drink. Would go back again. Enjoy the alcohol free cocktails!
2346,28 October 2015,40,They have the nicer staff in NYC,"I like music and I was happy to see all the collection guitars, shoes, dresses, etc belonging to ""the very best"" They had even the Abbey road real doors !! The food is very good, really tasty, and the staff was very very nice."
2347,28 October 2015,50,Great evening in easy surroundings,Been to several HRC and they never fail to satisfy. NYC Times Square Cafe is as good if not better than most. From the mayhem outside to a great atmosphere inside!
2348,28 October 2015,40,Nice experience,"A little slow at the bar, but nice people doing a nice job! Centrally located in the heart of time square."
2349,28 October 2015,50,Great Burger,"We were disappointed to find a queue at the Hard Rock Cafe and a half hour wait. We opted to take a seat at the bar and were able to eat there instead of waiting. Really great atmosphere and burger, very American!"
2350,28 October 2015,50,"Great atmosphere, food and gift shop!","Very impressed with this store, they have everything you'd expect from a Hard Rock franchise, however is the people that works there that make it special, not over the top, just right. I had a great lunch there too."
2351,28 October 2015,40,Good food but freezing cold inside,There is a lot of music memorabilia to look at. The food is good. However it is very cold inside and for us the music was far too loud.
2352,27 October 2015,50,hard rock cafe as usual,"a MUST in new york! it's a nice place, a spectacular wall with only guitars. the food is the same as allover. so we entered only to the shop to buy some stuff."
2353,27 October 2015,30,Just another Hard Rock Cafe,"There was nothing special about this HRC. Decent food and rock and roll atmosphere with lots of memorabilia. If you have never been to one then it is interesting but if you have been to any other one, nothing new here to see."
2354,27 October 2015,30,Typical Hard Rock Tourist Trap,"Food is OK, but price, drinks are good but pricey. This is a Gard Rock Cafe, not too different tan others, pretty much exclusively for tourists or people that have not yer visited a Gard Rock Cagfe."
2355,26 October 2015,40,Love The Atmospher,"Wow..just wow.. I went to 3 different hard rock cafe on my last trip.. and this HRC is the best. from the rock shop's collection, the atmospher, the location, the crwods, everything... The staffs also very helpful."
2356,26 October 2015,40,Midnight stop,"Checked out the memorabilia , Beatles outfits from Ed Sullivan Show , Lady Gaga from Madame Treaseau's , Guitar wall!!! ... fun stuff... great bathrooms..."
2357,26 October 2015,30,"Good service, average food","The hard rock is overrated, I've been to a few and this wasn't anything spectacular. Crazy busy in this place, waited for 45 minutes for a table for two. Our server was great though as were most of the other waiters."
2358,25 October 2015,50,Interesting,"Situated in bustling Times Square this is a very busy restaurant with pleasant and efficient staff, the food is good and the decor is brilliant. You could spend half an hour looking at the wall displays of music memorabilia. Well worth a visit."
2359,25 October 2015,40,Nice restaurant,The food was ok. I ordered a hamburger well done and it was almost well done. The decor is nice. Staff was very professional and friendly.
2360,25 October 2015,50,Great atmostphere,"I love the laid back atmosphere, with the rock and top 20's music blaring. The food is great and in a centralized location in Times Square."
2361,24 October 2015,40,Hardrock review,"Good dining experience. Bit pricey but you expect that for- 1) the chain & 20) Its location. Good service, a little noisy but great for music memorabilia lovers. I myself spent little time at the table, preferring to look around"
2362,22 October 2015,40,"""Great Visit to check out all the Musician's History of our Time & More""",We throughly enjoyed all the history of the Musician's of their time and to see all of the musical instruments right down to Billy Joel's motor bike. Friendly staff and well worth the visit if you are musically inclined.
2363,22 October 2015,50,super experience,I love atmosphere and environment of this franchise. One of the best choises in NYC. Try their coctails.
2364,22 October 2015,50,Friendly service to the end,Had a pre paid vochure which often creates a pronlem but not here! Fan time had b y us all! Well done!
2365,21 October 2015,40,showing my age!!!,"Food good and plenty ,loved the burgers, staff cool and very busy ,but to me (only my opition)I found it a young persons place,very loud music, I should have expected this,showing my age,but go for it if you are young at heart and enjoy"
2366,21 October 2015,50,An experience to share,"Whether you are alone, traveling as a couple or with friends you have to stop by this place as it is not only historical in nature but has fantastic service and huge menu that should satisfy anyone."
2367,20 October 2015,50,Great Burgers!,"Typical Hard Rock fare, we love their burgers!, Also dessert is always a favorite. Chocolate Cake YUM!"
2368,18 October 2015,50,10yrs@times.sq,"This is one of my two favorite Hard Rock cafes in the whole world. It is located at Times square, where its been for 10 years. This restaurant and its merchandise shop are always busy. Good vibes, good food, good service!"
2369,17 October 2015,40,First Visit,Strange as it may seem this was my first visit to this chain it will not be my last. I'm not usually a fan of burgers but the ones here could certainly convert me. It was delicious! Look forward to my next visit
2370,14 October 2015,50,Great place,"Great place for food, atmosphere and the service is fast. The price is a bit expensive but everything else is worth the detour"
2371,14 October 2015,40,Fun!,"We had lunch here during our recent family trip to NYC. Kids and adults enjoyed the atmosphere a lot. Nice opportunity to get picture taken with kids holding guitars against ""guitar wall"". Food was good, but not great. Overall an enjoyable experience."
2372,14 October 2015,30,Less than what expected!,It is similar to other franchise store all over the world except the abundance of security personnel everywhere. The bar was good and bar tenders are professional but not compare to other cool places all over NYC.
2373,13 October 2015,20,"Don't bother, it's not good",Went for breakfast and it was not good. Both the food and service were not good at all unfortunately. There are many other far better places in the area to go to
2374,11 October 2015,50,Great diner,"Good food, good atmosphere, great dining experience. Very large dining area, but advise to go earlyish as a queue was already forming at 18:00.."
2375,11 October 2015,30,Expensive,"This restaurant was very costly for very average food and drinks. We couldn't finish our food as it was tasteless, I had the macaroni which was quite sickly."
2376,9 October 2015,30,Average and Overpriced,Average food although Service was good. Had to wait for 30 minutes for a table but could have a drink at the bar. Drinks and food a little overpriced for what it is.
2377,9 October 2015,30,Not worth the line,"The food here is average at best, on par with any chain restaurant the draw is the rock memorabilia. Very cool memorabilia on display, does not make up for over priced average food items. Kids menu provides nice coloring book/souvenir"
2378,7 October 2015,40,A must try - original burger is outstanding,"Walking the area of Times Square renders hundreds of restaurants, but Hard Rock is a must try. Museum and surroundings gives you a great setting, food is good quality and prices are, considering the neighbour hood, reasonable. In addition good cocktails and nice desserts."
2379,7 October 2015,50,Hard Rock Cafe Times Square,"Loved this place, from the memorabilia, to the staff and the food!! Bought quite a lot of stuff from the shop too as my kids collect their T Shirts from wherever they go."

2382,5 October 2015,40,The best....so far!,"I've been to Hong Kong, Barcelona, Mumbai, Paris, London,Edinburgh and Glasgow but this is the best so far for memorabilia and atmosphere."
2383,3 October 2015,40,Hard Rock NYC,Obvious ambiance. Great server and friendly staff. Barbecue ribs were somewhat tasteless and not very meaty. Onion rings were a bit soggy.
2384,3 October 2015,40,Always wanted to visit here...glad I did,"Great vibe love the theatre style of this place and music theme, bar staff a little officious asking for ID I wasn't flattered I found it annoying, I'm 50 for crying out loud Bit expensive for basically burger and chips"

2400,23 September 2015,40,Hard rock cafe,Wanted a quick burger meal on way to a Broadway play down the street. Hard Rock Cafe was on the way so we went in. Got that burger in the bar area. Quicker service than the dining area.
2401,23 September 2015,40,Not a Better View of Times Square,"Lunch at the Hard Rock Café on Times Square may not be unique and exciting, but it has predictably good food and the best seat in the house for Times Square."
2402,23 September 2015,20,The Hard Rock is Not What it Used to Be.,A once reliable place to go for a decent meal at an okay price. This Times Square location has been a nightmare since it opened. How things have changed since the Hard Rock's 57th Street days and not for the better I'm sorry to say.
2403,22 September 2015,50,NYCHRC!,"Another great Hard Rock Cafe'!!! This is a "" must stop"" when in NYC!!!! Great Time! The Ribs are to die for. The décor here is fabulous and the service is outstanding!!!"

2461,11 August 2015,50,"Good food, long wait",I visited this establishment with my family. The wait was a bit long but once we were seated the service was amazing. I assume it's a tourist attraction so waiting comes with that.

2475,25 July 2015,40,Good for a break,The service was good and all the burgers come with french fries and sauce and they are very big. It's perfect for a little break for lunch and to spend some time with the family.
2476,22 July 2015,50,Great food and fun for families,Took our teenage grandson to celebrate as part of his graduation trip to NYC. Great place to eat and interesting decor. Would definitely go here again
2477,20 July 2015,50,Burgers with a bonus,We had a great dinner at the hard Rock and the lip sync by one of the waiters to lady Gaga was an added bonus! Our waitress was very attentive. My son loved his burger & the nachos were yummy too!
2478,19 July 2015,10,Absolute awful,Over priced service is terrible. Breakfast was a shambles would rather of given my money to the tramps outside than to this awful rip off restaurant.
2479,17 July 2015,30,overpriced,"very busy place with interesting rock decorations, we needed to que and wait for 15 min. the service was very basic, the food was overpriced.."
2480,16 July 2015,30,I don't get it,"Why do so many tourists flock to this chain restaurant? With so many other places to visit in NY and better food to eat, why go here?"
2481,16 July 2015,50,Good Food & Atmosphere,"Made to feel very welcome, Bar man was really helpful and professional. Food was excellent. Would return if in New York again."

2483,16 July 2015,30,Nice atmosphere,The food is okay but the atmosphere is good. Nice photo opportunity area where you can take your own photo in front of Hard Rock background. The large guitar hanging over the stairway is neat.
2484,15 July 2015,50,Great lunch in Times Square,"Right near center of Times Square, was told 25 min wait on a Sat afternoon, buzzer given and waiting area is big, buzzed in only 10 min. Air conditioning felt great on July day. Server very friendly, all our lunches were very good"
2485,15 July 2015,20,Very Basic Breakfast,Went here for breakfast. Not much to say other than poor choice and quality of food (served in a buffet style) with an expensive price tag. The redeeming feature would be the building itself which was interesting to take a look around.
2486,14 July 2015,40,Great steak and atmosphere,We were able find a seat at the bar right away. Bar tender was great. Food was cooked to order and the service was awesome.

2488,9 July 2015,30,"Great atmosphere, average food","Just like any other Hard Rock Cafe around the world, you should firstly visit to see the memorabilia as there is always something that you will have never seen before. As for the food, I ordered the Legendary Bacon Cheeseburger and was disappointed."
2489,9 July 2015,30,good food as usual - very poor service,"the place is as good as usual, the food is so good as usual, but what a deception about staff attitude, poor service, long service, so unusual over there. not good at all"
2490,9 July 2015,40,Fun Experience - Food is Average,This is a good place to stop in and have a drink to see all the music memorabilia etc. There is much better food throughout the City however the location in Time Square is easy to find and get to walking.
2491,9 July 2015,40,Great experience,"Good food, good service, lot's of interesting memorabilia to look at while you wait for a table. Been twice, would go again."
2492,8 July 2015,40,"Nice food , great memorabilia, good experience","We visited the shop and since there were tables available we also have visited the restaurant. The food was great, the memorabilias were perfect and the staff very friendly. We loved it."

2497,4 July 2015,40,Legendary,"Ambience of this place rocks. Wide variety of yummy cocktails. Just wish they had prices on the menu. Food ok. First place my hubby said of ""before we leave NY, I'm definitely coming here for a second visit """

2500,30 June 2015,30,Good food,Great place for lunch. Hamburgers and salads delicious. Memorabilia is really interesting. Staff very efficient.
2501,29 June 2015,40,"Standard experience, but no prices on the wine list","The food, service and ambience was the same as always. Good experience, exactly what we expected. However, the wine list had no prices. How can I decide what to order if I don't know what it is going to cost?"

2503,27 June 2015,30,Average,For Hard Rock Cafe the bar is really ok but with the burger we have been little disappointed especially as you know you pay more as its a Hard Rock Cafe. So go there if you like the atmosphere but not because of food.
2504,27 June 2015,20,Average,"This place has nothing on the Orlando one. The low rating is justified. Food was average. Service was slow. Not her fault, she no doubt had heaps of tables to attend to."
2505,25 June 2015,30,Average,"Had burgers from a speciality menu. They were of good quality, but dull. Have visited HRC in many countries and this place was below average."

2507,22 June 2015,50,Always fun,"Always a great place to visit. Dinner, snacks, cocktails, atmosphere always hard to beat. And of course you have to pick up a pin or a t-shirt"
2508,21 June 2015,10,"Food as expected, waiter in a bad mood",HRC NYC is large. Not crowded when we visited the place. Food was classic HRC as expected. Service was not. Our waiter had something to learn about being polite. There are better places to eat in NYC.
2509,21 June 2015,50,Fab cocktails,"Cocktails really good each night we would finish off our day in Hard Rock Cafe, staff great and they make great cocktails ."
2510,19 June 2015,20,So so,Very disappointed with this restaurant. Service was slow food very disappointing. Music far too loud. Fancy stuff around the walls but that's it. Avoid

2512,13 June 2015,30,"Luch, dinner yes, skip breakfast","We thought we'd have a good, hearty breakfast here, but it was just like any other bad motel buffet table. Price wasn't too bad $17, but it wasn't worth it."
2513,11 June 2015,40,very good,"the concept is probably known to everyone, the food is excellent and the service friendly and proffesional, and you can see some ''relics'' from stars, it isnt the cheapest but for once it cant hurt"
2514,9 June 2015,50,Usual standard,"Great place, lovely staff. Food was great. Had photo taken but was not asked to purchase it. Also visited for cocktails which are very impressive."

2518,3 June 2015,40,It's a Hard Rock Cafe!!,"Came in for lunch, it was busy but we were well taken care of and the food came quickly. Everything was great... It's a HRC and it does exactly what you expect from one."
2519,30 May 2015,40,Good burger and great venue,"Large and interesting space, burgers were good, pleasant enough place to have a couple of beers. It felt like the chain it has become, reliable.... yes, but not quite as unique as it used to be. Would return though."

2523,20 May 2015,30,Same as the others,"Long wait, I like Hard Rocks but went because my daughter wanted too. With so many restaurants to choose from in NYC I would not choose again. Drinks and food were fine. You of course went through gift shop to get in ."
2524,19 May 2015,50,Great,"I love it and I would definitely go there more than once. Good music, much space, not smoky, nice bathrooms. Prices fine and staff cool!"
2525,19 May 2015,20,Very mediocre,Food was very average. Poor beer selection. The atmosphere pails in comparison to other hard rock cafes around the world. And the service? Absolutely shocking!!!!! 30 mins to place an order - 30 mins to get the first round of drinks. Shocking.
2526,12 May 2015,40,Spareribs!!!!,"We had to wait half an hour, but the food was very good. Price is ok 😉 I was surprised about the really delicious and spicy spareribs"

2533,17 April 2015,50,Great Service,I have dietary restrictions which required a special order that was handled with no problem at all. Thank you to Kelly who was a wonderful waitress. I recommend to anyone who is in New York to stop in.
2534,13 April 2015,20,A load of fuss about nothing special,"Had to try it while in Manhattan. Nothing special, except the service, Danny was a real credit to a very average dining experience. Food was ok but there is so. Much better around,and not at sch a cost."
2535,8 April 2015,40,Always a favorite,"Hard Rock Cafe is always a favorite, because it's a great value and good food. They are very good at dealing with crowds, and move people in and out efficiently.We enjoy looking around at the unique music collectors items at each restaurant."

2544,18 March 2015,50,Relaxed enjoyable evening,The atmosphere has a rocky relaxed theme which is perfect for after a day of shopping or sight seeing. There was a variety of food and there were music channels playing so we had a little singalong.
2545,18 March 2015,50,great meal,only had to wait 30 minutes which was enough time to see around all the memrorabilia and gift shop. food was tasty with huge portions service was quick considering how busy the place was.
2546,17 March 2015,40,Well worth a visit,"Went for food and the queue was 1.5hrs, however if you go to the bar for a drink while you wait you can eat there and you are effectively skipping the queue, which was excellent for us. Try the New York strip, was very nice."
2547,17 March 2015,30,"Been here a few times when we visit, this was by far the most disappointing.","Had dinner here in December with my friend & our four teenagers. Our server was nice, but our orders were incorrect, items were omitted. Food was not as good as it had been in the past. Very disappointing especially for the price you pay."

2566,14 January 2015,40,Familiar quality,"Although this must be one of the world's best locations among Hard Rock Cafes, the food, service and atmosphere never seem to change. Great place to sit back and simultaneously process your food and experiences."
2567,14 January 2015,40,Best burger,"The best location for a big and jucy burger, simply hard Roch culture. Must visit if in town. Careful with desert :)"

2571,8 January 2015,40,Rock N Roll Fever!,Super cool Hard Rock Café! We waited around 45 minutes to dine for dinner. As your waiting you can walk around browse the café and store. This is by far one of my favorite Hard Rock Cafe's I have visited. Super fun and lively atmosphere.
2572,6 January 2015,40,Great staff!,Bar staff helped get us seated with a minor. Even asked a customer to move over for us! Everything after that was slow. Food was good as per the standard. Enjoy
2573,6 January 2015,40,Great staff and food,"We spent the christmas eve dinner and christmas day dinner too. The staff is super nice. The portions are very generous, do not underestimate it. Also the drinks, the fruitpalooza was one of the most delicious drinks i have ever drunk."
2574,1 January 2015,50,"Great food, Cold Drinks, Great atmosphere (just like always)!!","The price of food and drinks at Hard Rock is very reasonable especially for NYC.

2575,30 December 2014,40,Always good!,"Ate lunch with my family before Pinstripe Bowl game, 12/2014. Great atmosphere, food was good, wait time was set at 45 minutes, but seated after about only 25. Service was good. Great selection for kids."

2578,25 December 2014,30,Nice enough - no great shakes,"The staff are really friendly, the food is good (no more than expected) and the pricing is standard. Great atmosphere but all in all no more than expected of a hard rock."
2579,23 December 2014,50,Nice place for a drink,I had a couple of beers at the bar with a lil burger (1200kcal) nice music and friendly staff. Nice hard rock
2580,23 December 2014,20,Nothing special,"Didn't notice anything special, crazy overpriced. If you're not looking for anything history special place, check out other places with better service and food."
2581,21 December 2014,40,"Good, not great","A busy day for the cafe, too many private parties. Main dining area was slow. We got to the cafe just after 4 p.m. amen had to wait 45 minutes for a table. Server worked hard, food was tasty but warm."

2583,18 December 2014,30,As expected,"Went here for lunch while visiting time square. We've been to a couple Hard Rock restaurants and as expected, this was good. If you've never been to one I recommend it for the experience."
2584,18 December 2014,40,Good Burgers,Hard Rock Cafe is in times square and there is lot of customers but service is fast and burgers tasty.
2585,14 December 2014,30,Standard Hard Rock fair!,"I've eaten at HRC in various cities around the world, and the NYC one is well, just like all the rest! Decent food with huge amounts! Same decor, just a bigger place!"
2586,13 December 2014,30,Standard.,What you'd expect from any Hard Rock Cafe. Service and food was good. Had to sit at the bar and eat even though there were 15-20 empty tables.
2587,11 December 2014,30,Its a Hard Rock.,"Nothing great about this place. Nothing wrong with it either. Just a plain and simple Hard Rock. I went mid-week and didn't have to queue which was a bonus. The food was good, filling as usual. Service was also fine. Just nothing wowed me."
2588,10 December 2014,10,Go somewhere else,First time in New York and went here. Service was appalling and food even worse.... Our burger came up still frozen in the middle. Given a $25 gift card to say sorry but this can only be used on food
2589,7 December 2014,40,Fills Me Up,"Most Hard Rock Cafe food is the same at all locations. The menus might be a bit different, but the food is good and one thing they always do is fill up your plate, so you never leave hungry."
2590,3 December 2014,40,The Legendary Burger,"Try one, you won't be disappointed, and the fries are delicious. One of the best burger and chip meals I've ever eaten, in a brilliant setting full of musical history."
2591,2 December 2014,20,Overpriced diner food,"Hard Rock Café does offer a great atmosphere. If you want to just hang out with friend and not worried about the cuisine, then this is the place for you."
2592,2 December 2014,40,"Good food, neat interior","This is one of the better Hard Rock's I've visited. With New York's rich music history, it's great to see these vintage items. The Beatles suites are here among hundreds of other props."
2593,30 November 2014,30,was ok,Service was ok food a bit over priced compared to other hard rock cafes but worth a visit to the shop if you collect hard rock items.
2594,27 November 2014,30,Average Hard Rock Restaurant,"It is just like every other Hard Rock Cafe. If you've seen one, you've seen this one. Food and service were not bad but it was nothing extravagant. I would recommend going to a restaurant you can only find in NY and not a chain."
2595,27 November 2014,50,Another fabulous night,Had drinks and food sitting at the bar which we prefer. Great service very friendly. Thank you Josh. Great atmosphere x

2606,3 November 2014,30,Usual Hardrock,"Poor service, mediocre food, place could do with a good tidy up and some sort of system would help. But it's Hard Rock so will always attract, until you get in and have to wiat for service"

2623,1 October 2014,50,Worth a Wait,We love all of the Hard Rock Cafe's. The food was good and worth the wait for NYC. Price is higher in Manhattan than our home area of Phoenix and the wait was worth the half hour time to get seated.

2628,19 September 2014,40,yummy wings,"loved the wings - seasoned and not ""just hot"". the bruschetta was good too, large pieces of toast with a generous helping of fresh tomatoes, etc. Service was good - not too pushy, available when needed."
2629,17 September 2014,30,Good food,"The food was good and the place was typical hard rock. The service from our hostess was not so good though, it seemed to us that she was a bit tired of her job, which made the hole experience average."
2630,17 September 2014,30,Nothing special,Restaurant typical of this chain. We said we needed to eat quickly as going to a show and we did! The food and service was ok

2637,5 September 2014,30,Try it once,It was ok and nice to say I had been there but nothing special could get better food else where. Service was ok but not great
2638,2 September 2014,10,Will not return,The service and food were extremely poor. They ran out of ice while we were there. Service was slow. Shake was a WASTE of money. Very little shake or alcohol. Hamburger was average tasting. Do not waste your time here.
2639,2 September 2014,40,Hamburger Heaven,The hamburgers were wonderful. A wide selection. All around $ 16.00 which included fries. The decorations from so many musicians are fascinating and keep the kids busy and entertained.

2644,1 September 2014,30,Same Everywhere,"Usually this place is guaranteed good burgers for the family, but this visit was a little average. Mostly overdone and poor service due to number of guests eating."
2645,29 August 2014,30,Overpriced and distinctly average,Overpriced and distinctly average food only made up for by the setting and the great music mementos inside and out. Much better places than this around.
2646,28 August 2014,50,excellent food and drinks,"Food is fantastic, we had a Combo of appetizers along with our cocktails.it was fantastic and amazing and yummy..."
2647,28 August 2014,50,Speedy seating & service!,"Following reviews posted previously we left with plenty time before our show however there was no wait at all! We were seated immediately, all the staff were polite & friendly. The food was great as at every Hard Rock Cafe we have visited!"
2648,27 August 2014,50,Gorgeous food and great atmosphere,Brilliant service - there was a queue in which we had to wait to be seated but it was worth the wait! Not overly expensive either - but its not about price if your in new York.. its the experience :)

2651,16 August 2014,30,"Long wait for so, so food","Have been here several times, while checking out Broadway shows. Burgers and chicken sandwiches are good, but if you stray from the basics; watch out! Expect to wait, so don't go if you are in a rush or have a curtain to make."

2653,14 August 2014,30,Jog it on..,"Just tired of this place.. It's in Dublin, vegas & New York. Time for something totally new.. Food & service can't complain but just boring now.."
2654,12 August 2014,50,Good lunch,"Both the burger, the salad, the drinks and the waiter were doing a very good job. It is not the cheapest place to eat, but you do get a lot in return, including atmosphere."
2655,10 August 2014,50,Great lunch!,"Our first restaurant in NYC, it was a very neat place to go. In the heart of Time Square, very busy place! The food was great and the staff was very friendly!"

2660,5 August 2014,40,Typical Hard Rock,Standard Hard Rock experience. Decent food and decor. Crowded but that is to be expected given it's in Times Square and it's summer in NYC. Great if your just looking for a good chain restaurant.
2661,4 August 2014,30,Reasonably priced and convenient location,The food is what you would expect if you have been to a Hard Rock Cafe before. The service is good and you don't wait long for your meal to be delivered.

2666,27 July 2014,40,Average Hard Rock.,Food was typical Hard Rock - usual American favorites. The Hard Rock 'store' is street level and you have to walk downstairs for restaurant seating. Very dark and dim. Good bar service. The food quality/seasoning was very good so gave high marks.

2670,23 July 2014,40,"Great food, a bit noisy",We've eaten in Hard Rock Cafes in London & Florida. The food is pretty much standard (great quality). The New York restaurant is particularly noisy.
2671,23 July 2014,50,Great Food & Service,"I have never had a bad meal at a Hard Rock Cafe. We had not been to the one in NYC in years (since the old location, yes I'm old). We were not disappointed, everything was as good as any other HRC."

2678,11 July 2014,40,Hard Rock Cafe Rocks,"What a fun atmosphere in Times Square! The food was good, but this place is more about the atmosphere. The waiters are fun and the restaurant is really cool! It is a must see if you are a music fan. Teenagers will LOVE it!!!"

2730,16 February 2014,40,Buffet Breakfast,"Called in on a very cold morning for a hot breakfast buffet. Fresh food, although not a huge choice, efficient service and certainly didn't feel rushed (although difficult to believe you ever would on a cold February morning.)"
2731,9 February 2014,50,Yummy!,"As always the Hard Rock Cafe was nicely decorated. The bathrooms were clean! The food was delicious and there was plenty of it! However, don't ever order water unless you prefer drinking salty water. Yuk!"

2733,8 February 2014,40,"Good food, great location",Good food at a reasonable price and a great location on Times Square. Music wasn't too loud which is a good thing if you ask me.
2734,8 February 2014,40,Not bad!,"When you go to any Hard Rock Cafe, you expect a level of it being over commercial. The service, food and drinks however were good and the food was reasonably priced. We had to have a repeat visit as it was enjoyed so much."
2735,6 February 2014,50,Fun fun fun,So many historic things to see and the staff were excellent. The food and drinks were amazing as well and we got a lot of food for our money.

2740,16 January 2014,30,Food was okay - wouldn't return,"Standard fare... Although nothing in particular wrong with food, unless visiting for novelty value when in NYC eat elsewhere! Not the usual Hard Rock vibe"
2741,11 January 2014,30,Food not good but very entertaining.,"Ordered the jumbo combo & a salad, the jumbo combo was colder than the salad. The bartender was very entertaining and all of the Hard Rock Cafe decorations were very nice."
2742,8 January 2014,30,not worth the wait,good atmosphere but food very rushed and very average not worth the wait - tried 3 days to get in Plant Hollywood much better

2749,30 December 2013,40,As expected from a hard rock,The food Is great can't really go wrong as it's the same menu every where. Service was good but not great. It seamed to be a bit unorganised when you first arrive and are waiting to be seated.

2755,21 December 2013,40,Excellent atmosphere but remortgage the house!,"A long queue for tables with an hour wait - not surprising. The food was excellent and plentiful, the service very polite and efficient but VERY expensive for burger and chips!"
2756,20 December 2013,50,"Re-Visited, delicious","Once again the Hard Rock NYC did not disappoint, great food and extremely good service. Would recommend this for anyone visiting New York."
2757,17 December 2013,30,Disappointed,Very disappointed this time round - food came out freezing cold (twice) both the starter and the mains Hopefully was just a blip as have eaten at other hard rock cafés and never had an issue before the food is normally good!
2758,17 December 2013,50,"Quick Service, Good Food",We had an early dinner and was able to get immediate sitting at the bar. Staff was friendly and attentive. Pricing was fair based on where we are. I would definitely come back!
2759,14 December 2013,20,Waste of time (and lots of it),"Went with our three kids. Waited in line for about forty five minutes. When we finally made it in, service was so-so. Food was more greasy and diner-level. All in all - would not go again, in spite of the nice decor and atmosphere."
2760,10 December 2013,30,Good fun,"Went one evening, was fairly busy and a fun, upbeat atmosphere. Love all the memorabilia and music. Food was ok and the service not too bad, it was pretty busy but the waiter was good fun."

2763,28 November 2013,30,Go for the ambiance,Servers were nice but service was a bit slow. Food was average. Memorabilia was the best part of the place. Get there early to beat the lines.
2764,23 November 2013,40,Good Foods,"Four of us went to The Hard Rock at Time Square, good experience, good food . Everyone enjoyed the night out and also the desert was great."
2765,17 November 2013,40,Nice to try....,"We went when in New York out of curiosity. To go to the various/restaurant you must go downstairs. For drunks only you must sit around the bar. It is dark inside with lots of bright lights, but a good atmosphere with drinks reasonably priced."
2766,10 November 2013,50,One of the best restaurants in NYC.,"Wonderful atmosphere, awesome food and very welcoming staff. One of the best places in New York. I'll certainly be back!"
2767,3 November 2013,50,great burgers,Times Square-Hard Rock Cafe in october 2013. The hamburgers were delicious. The waiting time for a table 20 mins but so worth it.
2768,30 October 2013,20,!,Two rounds of drinks $60! No wonder the drinks menu doesn't have prices on. Food was OK though but nothing special.
2769,24 October 2013,50,Great time,"Perfect restaurant, fun and great food. Had a variety of food even for vegetarians and the energy was great. Lots of entertainment and all the waiters and waitresses were always happy. The meals were really big though for someone from the UK!!"
2770,23 October 2013,20,Not your typical H. Rock experience car,"I've been to many around the world and for a great city like NY, I'd expected a little bit more 'bang'! Mild music, under-welmed by the service and mood in the place!"

One drink walking around enjoying all the Elton John costumes, many guitars,pictures & motorcycles. Lots of things and people to look at. Did not eat. But this was an interesting stop along the way."
2773,16 October 2013,50,Tasty..but overpriced,"The food was lovely, yet somewhat overpriced. Considering the size of portions you can get in other restaurants for half the price then its not as good as what people make out. The food if decent though."
2774,6 October 2013,40,Massive portions!!,"Fun atmosphere, excellent service, delicious food and drinks!! Slight wait to be seated, as to be expected!! Portions here are huge, so we did waste a fair bit of food!! Going back in Jan 2014 and this is on our list to visit again!!!"

2778,19 September 2013,40,Like all other Hard Rocks,"If you know what a Hard Rock Café is like, this is the same. Their store is worth a stop at even if you don't eat there because they have nice pins unique to NYC that are always changing and updating. Convenient to Times Square."
2779,19 September 2013,50,Good Food and Service,Had lunch there as I was told it was an original building however it has been updated. Typical hard rock care.
2780,12 September 2013,30,Not very special.,"We have been in Hard Rock Cafes all around the world and was expecting the one in NYC to be quite special. We were disappointed in the memorabilia, and the food was only average. Would not bother again."

2789,30 August 2013,50,School Trip,"I went here in June 2012 on a school trip and its a trip that I will deinitely never forget. The atmosphere was brilliant and the staff were really nice, they even took pictures with us. I would highly recommend this place!"

2795,24 August 2013,30,Decent food and service!,"The kids wanted to try this one because they had never been to this location. Everything was just average in both food and service. We were there pretty late so perhaps the time has something to do with it. In a pinch, worth the time."
2796,22 August 2013,50,Good atmosphere,"This famous café proposed unforgettable atmosphere, tasty dishes, good service and unexpectable reasonable prices. We were 5 hungry adults and finished with drinks and fully loaded at about 120$."

2919,2 October 2012,40,Good hamburgers and Eccellent sandwich,We stayed in NY four days and went twice to HR Cafe. Always had great hamburgers and an excellent Texas Sandwich. Service very friendly but may be too much inclined towards gratuities.
2920,28 September 2012,30,A family place in the middle of Broadway,"Decent food, but not great. Fair prices, kid friendly. Altogether a decent place for a quick lunch in the theater district."
2921,26 September 2012,30,Pretty good breakfast buffet,"Server was rushed you could tell, but did a good job. Eggs were a bit runny but the pancake dippers and sausages we're good. 40 bucks for breakfast is a bit steep tho."

2933,30 August 2012,40,The Best Burger anywhere!,"First night in New York? Go to Times Square after a beer in Bryant Park and go to the Hard Rock Cafe. Its Legendary Burger is unbeatable - beautifully cooked rare burger with home-fries and salad, great value for your $15."

2936,23 August 2012,30,Not impressed,"The service was great, but the food was mediocre at best. Very disappointing. It was so chilly in the restaurant that we couldn't wait to get outside. If you like fast food, a chilly environment then this is the place for you."
2937,17 August 2012,30,good place for a drink,good place right at the edge of times square to get a drink and always a great place to see all the people.
2938,15 August 2012,30,"Even If You Visit Only Once, Visit","Its loud, its pricey and the food is just above average but its Hard Rock Cafe Times Square New York.

2939,15 August 2012,40,Never fails to please- Times Square Branch,I eat at Hard Rocks everywhere as I like the fact that I know hat I am getting. My favorite meal is the pulled pork sandwich. The brand standard of this restaurant chain is second to none.
2940,13 August 2012,40,Fun!,Went here as a family. Food prices were as expected and not that outrageous. A family of 4 cost approx. $80 and that included alcohol and a glass to take home. The food was very good and the portion sizes were huge!
2941,13 August 2012,30,Broadway Prices,Food was ok and drinks were expensive. Very large but not very clean. Good if you are in a rush and want a place to feed the kids near the the theatre district.
2942,6 August 2012,40,Pin Man was Awesome,"The restaurant is your typical Hard Rock but our server, ""The Pin Man"" was awesome. A little pricey for ""bar food"" though. We were seated rather quickly and our server was very responsive to all our needs."
2943,25 July 2012,50,Cool and nice food,"The California burger was awesome, and the drinks as well! Worth a visit. For only 10 dollars you get a souvenir glass (included drink) as well!"

2947,24 July 2012,40,Nice restaurant while in NYC with family,"Kids love this place when we are in NYC, lots a fun items to looks at, and in the middle of Times Square"
2948,23 July 2012,30,Average,"Meal was ok but wife's chicken was undercooked. Your really paying for the name and location. Better to find elsewhere and less crowded, especially with people walking around looking at the walls."

2953,15 July 2012,50,Typical Hard Rock Cafe,We have visited many Hard Rock Cafes. I think they pretty much are all the same. We make it a point to visit if there is one near our destination. We enjoy collecting HRC tshirts and pins.
2954,12 July 2012,50,Love the place,How could one not love this place Always a seat at the bar Great service and music Convenient restrooms
2955,10 July 2012,50,Great times and great food.,"Service was great, food always good, and great music, atmosphere. Great for the entire family at lunch or dinner. We happen to eat there 2 days out of 4 day trip, and the kids loved it."

2963,25 June 2012,40,Tasty but a little pricey,We ordered the steak which was delicious although a tad pricey. It was also a bit loud compared to the other hard rock cafes we've visited. Interesting layout in an old theater
2964,24 June 2012,40,Like any other in the world,"Nice decoration. Liked the guitars in the wall when you get downstairs. Good food...but the chicken fingers were soooo spicy I could barely eat them! They have to improve their cocktails...worst mojito ever, but loved the Southern Rock."
2965,24 June 2012,30,OK,"Not the best HardRock I have been in Orlando the best - service good - food average, surroundings poor"
2966,20 June 2012,50,Great breakfast buffet,"We were surprised how few people eat breakfast there. Not the greatest food, but good value and plenty of it. Plus you get the place to yourself to wander round and look at the memorabilia."
2967,19 June 2012,40,Memorabilia haven - great music,"Wait staff was attentive. Food was better than expected, we were there for a light lunch. A little of a wait but the climb up the stairs had lots to look at."
2968,18 June 2012,50,Really Great!,"I'm not crazy about branch restaurants, but I'm pleased with my visits this Hard Rock. I have no complaints at all about this location. Everything meet my very high standards."
2969,16 June 2012,30,Went more for the brand and not for the food,Maybe i assumed that it was going to be something greater than it was. You're paying for the chain food brand but not for the food....
2970,16 June 2012,40,like,I love going into this place for a look around especially the massive guitar on the ceiling
2971,13 June 2012,50,Best cocktail and service ever!,"While we were in NY, we went at least 6 or 7 times out of 10 nights. They definitely make the best cocktails and the staff is incredibly sweet and helpful."
2972,12 June 2012,30,Not too impressed,No queue and went straight in. The air conditioning was way to low and it was freezing. Our waitress was very good though and tried hard to please. The food was average and the atmosphere was lacking. Have been in better Hard Rock cafes.
2973,12 June 2012,30,Corporate Private Event,"Large space for a private event, food stations were average."
2974,1 June 2012,40,Fun to Go to,"We love the NYC Hard Rock. It is VERY popular with tourists. Go early, or you will have a long wait. The food is expensive and fairly good. My teens like the music memorabilia, displays and music videos playing."

3031,29 December 2011,30,Typical Hard Rock,Food was good but expensive. Location in Time Square doesn't get much better. Forget about any type of conversation is was way to loud. I like loud music but the quality and the type of music gave me a headache.
